PREFACE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Every</span> year fire destroys an enormous
amount of property in the
United States. Of this great loss
by which our country is made just so
much poorer, for property destroyed by
fire is gone forever and cannot be replaced,
a large proportion is due to carelessness,
thoughtlessness, and ignorance. Nor is it
a property loss only. Every fire endangers
human life, and the number of lives
lost in this way in one year is truly
appalling.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that if all the
buildings burned in one year were placed
close together on both sides of a street,
they would make an avenue of desolation
reaching from Chicago to New York City.
At each thousand feet there would be a
building from which a severely injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
person had been rescued, and every three-quarters
of a mile would stand the blackened
ruins of a house in which some one
had been burned to death.</p>

<p>Children are allowed to burn dry leaves
in the fall, and their clothing catches fire
from the flames; women pour kerosene
on the fire in their kitchen stoves, or
cleanse clothing with gasoline near an
open blaze; thoughtless men toss lighted
cigars and cigarettes into a heap of rubbish,
or drop them from an upper window
into an awning; the head of a parlor match
flies into muslin draperies; a Christmas-tree
is set on fire with lighted candles, or
a careless hunter starts a forest fire which
burns for days and destroys valuable
timber lands. There are hundreds of
different ways in which fires are set. The
majority of these fires, which cause great
loss of life and property and untold suffering,
are preventable by ordinary
precaution.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>This little book has been written for
the special purpose of teaching children
how to avoid setting a fire, how to extinguish
one, or how to hold one in check
until the arrival of help. Each story tells
how a fire was started, how it should have
been avoided, and how it was put out:
Mr. Brown Rat builds his nest with
matches which were left around the
house; Careless Joe pours hot ashes into
a wooden box; or boys light a bonfire and
leave the hot embers, and then old North
Wind comes along and has a bonfire
himself.</p>

<p>At the end of each lesson there are
instructions regarding the fire in question.
There are also chapters on such subjects
as our loss by forest fires, the work of our
firemen, common safeguards against fire,
how to act in case the house is on fire,
and first aid to those who are injured by
fire,&mdash;how to treat scalds and burns, how
to revive persons who are suffocated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
smoke, etc. A thoughtful reading of this
book should make the present generation
a more careful and less destructive people,
and the entire country richer and more
prosperous.</p>

<h2>BROWNIE'S MISFORTUNE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Polly's</span> cage had just been hung out
on the back porch, and she was taking
a sun bath. She ruffled up her
feathers and spread out her wings and tail.</p>

<p>She knew she was pretty, and as the
sun brightened her plumage, she arched
her neck, and looked down at herself,
saying over and over, "Pretty Polly!
Polly! Pretty Polly!"</p>

<p>Then she threw back her head and
laughed one of those jolly, contagious
chuckles that made everyone laugh with
her.</p>

<p>While she sat there, talking and laughing,
a big brown rat came creeping up the
steps. Polly had often seen him before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
for he came to the house every day to
find something to eat; and as he always
stopped to have a chat, the two had become
good friends.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Polly," said Mr.
Brown Rat. "You seem very happy this
morning."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be happy?" replied
Polly. "See how pretty I am. Besides,
I have nothing to do all day but sit here
and eat crackers and watch the people.
By the way, Brownie, run into the house
and get me a cracker now."</p>

<p>"I can't get any more crackers, Polly,"
replied the rat. "The last time I went to
the pantry the crackers were in a stone
jar that had a heavy cover."</p>

<p>Polly ruffled up her feathers, and spread
out her wings so that they would shine in
the sun.</p>

<p>"You are very pretty, Polly," said Mr.
Brown Rat, "but you haven't such a
fine long tail as I have;" and he spread it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
out on the piazza and twisted his head to
look at it.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! you wait until the cat gets
hold of it and it won't be very long,"
replied Polly. "Why don't you shave off
your whiskers, Brownie?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't smell any cheese if I lost
my whiskers," said Brownie. "And, besides,
they make me look dignified with
my family.</p>

<p>"Polly, I am going to build a new
house," he added. "I am tired of living
in barns and stone walls, and I want my
family together where it is warm and
comfortable. Do you happen to know
where I can find some matches?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied Polly, "my master
is very careless with his matches. He
leaves them around loose wherever he
goes. You see, he doesn't use the matches
that have to be struck on a box, and
every time he lights his pipe he scratches
the matches on anything that is handy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
They are snapping and cracking all day
long. Sometimes they break off and fly
away, all on fire. You can find them
almost anywhere in the house. But what
do you want to do with matches,
Brownie?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Polly, the little sticks
make a good framework for my house.
The wood is good to chew and can be
made soft for lining the nest; and the bits
of flint in the head of the match are fine
for sharpening and filing my teeth."</p>

<p>"You and your family won't be able
to file out of the house if you light one of
those matches while you are filing your
teeth," said Polly, and she gave another
of her famous chuckles.</p>

<p>"I'll look out for that," replied Mr.
Brown Rat, as he scampered across the
piazza.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to build a nest with
matches in my house," Polly screamed
after him; but Brownie slipped through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a hole in the clapboards under the kitchen
window and didn't make any promises.</p>

<p>Polly didn't see her friend again for
some time and she began to miss him.</p>

<p>One day she heard her master say, "I
wonder what becomes of all my matches?"
and this set her to thinking.</p>

<p>She sat still on her perch for a long
time, scratching her head with first one
foot and then another. "I believe Brownie
is really building his nest in this house,"
she said to herself at last; "and he is
using matches, too, after I told him
not to."</p>

<p>Then she became very angry. She
screamed and bit the bars of her cage
with her sharp bill until the cook came out
and scolded her for being so cross.</p>

<p>Two or three days later Polly was hanging
on the back porch again, and the sun
was shining on her feathers. She was
spreading out her wings, and cocking her
head on one side, when, all of a sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
she saw a thin curl of blue smoke creeping
out between the clapboards.</p>

<p>"Hello! Help! Come in!" she screamed.
"Hello! Help! Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>Some boys who were playing in the
street came running up to the house at
the cry of fire.</p>

<p>"Get a move on!" cried Polly, dancing
about in her cage and trying her best to
open the door.</p>

<p>"Where's the fire?" asked one of the
boys.</p>

<p>"Get busy!" screamed Polly, as she
pulled herself up to the top of the cage.</p>

<p>Just then a wagon came tearing down
the street. "Whoa!" cried Polly, and,
sure enough, the horses stopped in front
of the house.</p>

<p>The driver saw the smoke, and he went
to work in a hurry, tearing off the clapboards,
and showing the boys where to
pour water in between the walls, until the
fire was all out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>When the man had gone away, and
everything was quiet, Mr. Brown Rat
came creeping out of the hole, wet and
bedraggled, with his whiskers all burned
off.</p>

<p>Polly caught sight of him in a moment.
"You rascal," she screamed, "you set
that fire. You ought to know better than
to build a house with matches."</p>

<p>"I do now, and I'll never do it again,
never again," replied Brownie meekly, as
he went limping away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did the brown rat come out on the
back porch?</i></p>

<p><i>How did he build his nest?</i></p>

<p><i>Of what material was it constructed?</i></p>

<p><i>Why do rats like matches?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is it dangerous to leave matches
scattered around the house?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That rats and mice are responsible for
many fires is no longer doubted. The
evidence has been plainly seen. Rats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and matches are a dangerous combination.
For this reason matches should not
be scattered around the house.</p>

<p>In most of the European countries only
safety matches can be used; this is one
reason for the small number of fires in
foreign lands as compared with those in
the United States.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">"CARELESS JOE"</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">"I didn't</span> mean to lose my coat,
Father. We boys were playing ball,
and I threw it down on the ground
and forgot all about it until I got home.
Then I went back for it and it was gone.
Some thief had stolen it, I suppose. I
can't help it now, can I?"</p>

<p>"No, Joe, of course you can't," his
father answered; "but you are always
doing something like this, and I want you
to learn to be more careful. It is just the
same with your work. Half of it is forgotten,
and the other half is not well done.
I can't trust you to do anything. You are
so forgetful and careless that even your
school-mates call you 'Careless Joe.' It
is no wonder that your mother and I are
discouraged."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Mr. and Mrs. Patten were very fond of
Joe, who was their only son, and they did
everything they could for his happiness;
but the boy had grown so careless and
selfish that his father and mother were at
their wits' end to know what to do with
him.</p>

<p>As for Joe, he was a pleasant-faced,
good-hearted, jolly boy; but his parents
knew that this one bad habit of carelessness
would soon spoil him if it were not
corrected. They had done everything
they could to help him overcome his
fault, but he only seemed to grow more
careless every day.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Patten said to his wife,
"Let's send Joe to visit Grandfather
Knight. He knows how to manage boys
pretty well."</p>

<p>Of course Joe was delighted when he
heard of the plan, for who ever saw a boy
who didn't like to visit his grandfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. Patten wrote to Grandma Knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
about Joe's bad habit, which was giving
them so much trouble; and the two old
people talked it all over and felt sure that
they would know what to do when the
time came.</p>

<p>"I'll keep the boy so busy that he won't
have any time to forget," said his grandfather.
"There is always plenty of work
on a farm for a good boy."</p>

<p>"He can help me, too," added Grandma.
"I'll pay him with cookies;" and she
hurried out to the kitchen to make a big
jarful of the round sugar cookies that Joe
liked best.</p>

<p>Joe was delighted with everything on
the farm, and for several days he did very
well.</p>

<p>"He isn't such a bad boy after all,"
Grandpa told Grandma when Joe had
gone upstairs to bed one night.</p>

<p>But the very next morning he gave Joe
a bucket of grain to feed the hens, and in
the afternoon he found the bucket in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
barn, still full of grain. When he spoke
to Joe about it, the boy answered carelessly,
"Oh, yes, I did forget it; but it
won't matter much, will it? Hens can't
tell the time of day."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," his grandfather replied;
"but I don't believe they like to
go hungry any better than you do."</p>

<p>The next night Joe went to the pasture
to get the cows, and came home driving
nine, when he knew very well that his
grandfather had ten. He never noticed
the difference until Grandpa spoke to him
about it, and then he seemed to care so
little that the good old man began to
think Joe one of the most careless boys
he ever saw.</p>

<p>Two or three days later Mr. Knight
went to market, leaving Joe to feed the
horses at noon. When he reached home
at night, the horses had not been fed, and
Joe said he didn't think they would mind
going without one dinner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Grandma Knight heard this remark,
and she decided that it was about time
for Joe to have a lesson. When the boy
came in to supper, feeling very hungry
after a good game of ball, there sat his
grandmother knitting a stocking.</p>

<p>He glanced around the kitchen in surprise.
"My stomach feels pretty empty,"
he said; "but I don't see anything to eat.
Isn't it almost supper-time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," his grandmother answered,
with a twinkle in her eye, "it is
supper-time; but I thought you wouldn't
mind going without one supper, so I
didn't get any to-night."</p>

<p>Joe frowned and hung his head. He
knew very well what his grandmother
meant, and things went a little better for
a day or two; but the boy soon fell back
into his old tricks.</p>

<p>Every morning Joe emptied the ashes
from the kitchen stove for his grandmother.
Grandpa Knight had told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
over and over again never to empty them
until they were cool, and always to put
them in an iron barrel that stood in the
shed.</p>

<p>One morning Joe went as usual to empty
the ashes, which happened to have a good
many live coals in them. The iron barrel
was full, but Joe was in a hurry to get away
for a game of ball. He couldn't bother to
empty the barrel, and he surely couldn't
wait for the ashes to cool, so he tipped
them into a wooden box, live coals and all,
and ran off to his game.</p>

<p>Grandma Knight was making another
big batch of cookies, and it was not
long before she began to smell smoke.
She looked all around the stove, but
she couldn't find anything that was
burning.</p>

<p>"It must be some paper I threw into the
fire," she said to herself, and she went
on with her baking.</p>

<p>But the smell of smoke grew stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and stronger, and when she came out of
the pantry to slip the first pan of cookies
into the oven, she could see a thin blue
haze in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"The house is on fire!" she cried, and
she ran down cellar and upstairs as fast
as she could go, opening all the doors and
looking in all the closets to find out what
was burning.</p>

<p>On her way through the hall she caught
up a fire-extinguisher; but she couldn't
find a sign of the fire anywhere. At last
she ran out through the shed to call
Grandpa Knight from the barn, and there
was the wooden box blazing merrily, and
sending little tongues of hot flame across
the floor.</p>

<p>It took only a few minutes to put out
the fire with the fire-extinguisher which
she still held in her hand; but when
Grandpa came into the house a few
minutes later, there was Grandma Knight
sitting beside the kitchen table, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a pan of black cookies, with tears running
down her wrinkled cheeks.</p>

<p>"I never burned a cooky before in all
my life," she said, trying to smile through
the tears; "but I couldn't let the house
burn down!" and then, all trembling with
excitement, she told about the fire in the
shed, and the box of hot ashes.</p>

<p>When Careless Joe came home to dinner
there was a pan of burned cookies beside
his plate, and that afternoon he had a talk
with his grandfather which he never forgot.</p>

<p>From that day he really did try to overcome
his careless, selfish ways, and to be
more thoughtful and manly. He had
learned that fire is not to be trifled with,
and that a boy must always have his mind
on his work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why was this boy called "Careless Joe"?</i></p>

<p><i>In what way was he careless?</i></p>

<p><i>What lesson did his grandmother teach
him?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><i>What happened which taught him a
more serious lesson?</i></p>

<p><i>How should ashes be cared for?</i></p>

<p><i>What kind of a barrel should they be kept
in?</i></p>

<p><i>What should be done with rubbish and
waste paper?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Ashes should never be kept in wooden
barrels or boxes, but in iron barrels or
brick bins. There should never be an
ash-heap against a fence or near the side
of a house. Paper and rubbish should not
be mixed with ashes, but kept in a separate
barrel.</p>

<p>Cellars and basements should be clean,
orderly, and well-lighted. Rubbish is a
fire-breeder, and may be the means of
destroying your home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAY DAY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was May Day, and all the children
who went to school in the little brick
schoolhouse at the foot of the hill
were going "Maying."</p>

<p>Every sunny morning in April they had
begged their teacher to go with them to
the woods to gather flowers; but Miss
Heath kept telling them to wait until the
days were a little warmer, and the woods
less damp.</p>

<p>"By the first of May," she said, "there
will be ever so many more flowers. If
May Day is bright and sunny we will
have no school,&mdash;except the school of the
woods, no lessons but those the birds and
flowers teach us. Wear your oldest clothes,
and don't forget your lunches. You will
be as hungry as squirrels when you have
played out of doors all the morning."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>The first morning in May was warm
and sunny enough to make everyone long
to spend the whole day in the woods.</p>

<p>At half-past eight all the pupils in Miss
Heath's school were at the schoolhouse
door, eager for the Maying. There were
only sixteen of them, and they were of all
ages, from five to fourteen, for the little
brick schoolhouse was in the country, far
away from the graded city schools.</p>

<p>The mothers had not forgotten the
lunches, and it was a happy band of boys
and girls that set off at nine o'clock for
the woods. They climbed the hill and
followed a cart-path until they came to a
shady hollow where a tiny brook rippled
over its stony bed.</p>

<p>"We'll stay here for a little while and
watch the birds," said Miss Heath. "Sit
down under this pine tree, and keep as
still as mice until you have seen five different
birds."</p>

<p>Joe Thorpe saw the first one,&mdash;a robin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that came down to the brook for a drink
of water. Alice Fletcher caught sight of
a black and white warbler that was hopping
about in the pine tree, and Grace Atkins
pointed out a woodpecker that was rapping
on the trunk of an old oak.</p>

<p>A golden oriole flew to the top of a tall
elm and called down to them, "Look,
look, look! Look up here! Look up here!
Look up here!" But the fifth bird was
hard to find. They had almost given him
up when Miss Heath held up her hand.
"Listen!" she whispered, and in a moment
a song sparrow that had lighted in
a little bush near by sang them his sweetest
song,&mdash;sang it over and over, with
his head held high and his tiny throat
swelling with the music.</p>

<p>"There are the five birds," said Miss
Heath, when the song sparrow flew away;
"now for our flowers!" and she jumped
up and led the way across the brook
and down a gentle slope toward an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
pasture that was half overgrown with
underbrush.</p>

<p>"You must notice all the different shades
of green in the new leaves on the trees,
with the yellows and reds on the bushes,"
she said, as they stood looking across the
pasture. "There are almost as many
colors among the trees in the spring as
there are in the fall, but they are not so
brilliant.</p>

<p>"Now, run and look for flowers," she
added, when they had climbed over a
stone wall and found a narrow foot-path
across the pasture. "I will wait here,
under this chestnut tree, and you can
come back when you are ready; but if I
call, you must come at once. It will be
lunch-time almost before you know it."</p>

<p>That old pasture was a splendid place
to find spring flowers, and the children
scattered in all directions, by twos and
threes, peeping under bushes and poking
away dead leaves to hunt for sprays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
arbutus, or Mayflowers as they always
called them.</p>

<p>Grace and Alice found some beautiful
clusters of the fragrant pink and white
blossoms, but poor little Joe Thorpe
didn't have good luck at all, so he wandered
off by himself to look for hepaticas.</p>

<p>He found them, too, among the rocks
at the farther end of the field, blue ones
and white ones, and some that were pink
and lavender; and when he had picked a
good handful for Miss Heath, he saw
some "spring beauties," white blossoms
striped with pink that swayed gently on
their slender stems.</p>

<p>Just then he heard the call to lunch,
and although he hurried back to the big
chestnut tree he found all the children
there before him, their hands filled with
flowers. There were bunches of blue
violets and white violets, hepaticas and
spring beauties. One girl had found
yellow adder's tongues with their spotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
leaves, and a boy brought a Jack-in-the-pulpit,
standing up stiff and straight to
preach its little sermon.</p>

<p>After Miss Heath had admired all the
flowers, and had sent three of the boys
back to the brook for water, the children
opened the baskets and spread their lunch
on newspaper tablecloths.</p>

<p>Then what a merry picnic they had!
They exchanged cakes and cookies, gingerbread
and doughnuts. They shared
pickles and apples, and divided turnovers
and saucer pies,&mdash;and they all picked
out the very best of everything for Miss
Heath, until she laughingly declared that
she couldn't eat another single mouthful.</p>

<p>After lunch they told stories and played
games, until, all at once, the teacher noticed
that the sun had hidden his face behind
a heavy cloud.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is going to rain," she
said; "we must hurry home."</p>

<p>But even before the children could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gather up their baskets and flowers, the
big rain-drops began to patter down on
their heads.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said little Joe Thorpe.
"It is nothing but an April shower."</p>

<p>"April showers bring Mayflowers!"
quoted Grace and Alice, and then they
held their thumbs together and wished,
because they had both said just the same
thing at just the same moment.</p>

<p>"They bring wet dresses, too," said
Miss Heath, "and not one of us has an
umbrella. Let's run over to that little
pine grove and play the trees are umbrellas.
That's what the birds do when it rains."</p>

<p>The children ran down the narrow path
and gathered under the spreading branches
of the pines, and the trees held out their
arms and tried to keep them dry. But
the rain-drops came down faster and
faster, and it was not long before the little
girls' cotton dresses were wet through.</p>

<p>As soon as the shower was over Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Heath said, "Now you must run home
as fast as you can, and put on dry
clothing. I don't want anyone to catch
cold when we have had such a happy
day together."</p>

<p>So away the children scampered, some
in one direction, some in another. At the
foot of the hill Alice stopped suddenly
and said to Grace, "My mother will not
be at home. She was going to the village
this afternoon to do some marketing."</p>

<p>"Come to my house," said Grace.
"You can put on one of my dresses while
yours is getting dry."</p>

<p>When they reached Grace's house her
mother was not at home, either; but
Grace found the key to the back door
behind the window blind, and the two
little girls went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Then they took off their wet dresses
and put on dry ones, and Grace climbed
up in a chair to hang Alice's dress on the
clothes-bars over the stove.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>"It will not dry very fast until we open
the dampers and let the fire burn up," she
said; so she opened both dampers wide,
and then took Alice up to the play-room
to see the new doll which her aunt had
sent her for a birthday gift. The doll
had a whole trunkful of dresses, coats,
hats, and shoes, and the two little girls
had such a good time trying them on that
they forgot all about the kitchen stove.</p>

<p>Suddenly Grace cried, "I can smell
smoke, Alice. Something is burning!"</p>

<p>"It must be my dress," exclaimed Alice,
jumping up and running down the back
stairs.</p>

<p>She opened the kitchen door just in
time to see the dress burst into flames.
"Oh, what shall we do?" she cried. "My
dress is on fire! Put it out! Put it out!
Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>"I can't!" screamed Grace. "Oh,
Mother! Mother! Come home! Come
home!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Just then a man, who was driving by
with a load of wood, saw the flames
through the window and came running in
to see what was the matter. He snatched
the burning dress from the clothes-bars,
threw it into the sink, and pumped water
over it to put out the fire.</p>

<p>Then he closed the dampers in the stove,
which was now red hot, and opened the
windows at the top to let out the smoke;
while all the time the two little girls stood
in the middle of the floor, sobbing and
crying.</p>

<p>"That was a very careless thing to do,"
said the man, when at last they told him
how the dress happened to catch fire.
"You should never hang anything over
the stove. Tell your mother to take down
those clothes-bars this very afternoon, and
put them on the other side of the kitchen;
and remember never to go out of the room
again when you have started up the fire.
A red-hot stove will sometimes set wood-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
on fire, even if there isn't a cotton
dress near by to help it along."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I shall forget it very
soon," said Grace, as she lifted the handful
of wet black rags out of the sink.</p>

<p>"Nor I," cried Alice. "I am glad Miss
Heath told us to wear our old clothes."</p>

<p>"And I am glad that I came along
before you set the house on fire," said the
man. "Don't ever try to dry wet clothes
in a hurry again."</p>

<p>Then he went out and climbed up on
his load of wood, muttering to himself,
"That's what comes of leaving children
alone in the house. They are never satisfied
unless they are lighting matches or
starting a fire."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did Grace hang the dress over the
stove?</i></p>

<p><i>How did it catch fire?</i></p>

<p><i>What material was the dress made of?</i></p>

<p><i>Would a woollen dress burn as easily?</i></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Damp clothing, or clothes that have
just been ironed, should never be hung
over a hot stove, for, as the moisture
dries out, the clothes quickly ignite.
Clothes-bars or a clothes-line should never
be hung over a stove, and a clothes-horse
should not be set too near it. Many fires
have resulted from an overloaded clothes-horse
falling on a hot stove, especially
when there was no one in the kitchen
to watch it.</p>

<p>Children should never be permitted to
open the dampers of a stove, or to have
anything whatever to do with the kitchen
fire. They should not set a kettle on the
stove or take one off, and they should be
cautioned against climbing into a chair
near the stove, as they might fall and be
badly burned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CAMPING OUT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of those hot drowsy days in
July. School had been closed two
weeks, and Dean and Gordon Rand
were already wondering how they could
ever spend the rest of the long vacation in
their little home in the city of Boston.</p>

<p>To be sure there were plenty of books
filled with charming stories of brooks and
pine woods; but reading only made the
boys wish they might go to the real country
instead of sitting at home in a hot stuffy
house, reading about it in a story-book.</p>

<p>One night the two brothers went as
usual to meet their father when he came
home from work. His tired face wore a
happy smile, and they knew at once that
something pleasant had happened.</p>

<p>"What is it, Father? Do tell us!" the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
boys cried in one voice. Their faces were
so eager that it was really hard for Mr.
Rand to say, "Wait, my boys, until we
reach home. Then your mother can share
the good news with us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rand was looking out of the
window as the boys danced up the front
walk, each holding one of their father's
hands. They pulled him along in their
haste to hear the news, and she, too,
guessed that something pleasant had
happened.</p>

<p>Father said that boys couldn't half
enjoy good news with dirty hands and
faces, so it was not until soap and water
had made them clean and shining that he
took from his pocket a letter from good
jolly Uncle Joe who lived among the hills
of Vermont.</p>

<p>"Here is your news," he said. "I will
read aloud the part of the letter that will
interest you. Now, listen! Uncle Joe
says: 'Why not let those boys of yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
come up and go camping with me this
summer? I am going to pitch my tent
in the woods near Silver Lake, and I expect
to have good fishing and hunting.
Send the youngsters along as soon as they
are ready. I will take care of them, and
give them a rollicking good time.'"</p>

<p>The boys were so delighted that they
could hardly wait for Mother to get their
clothes ready, and for Father to write to
Uncle Joe and tell him when and where
to meet them.</p>

<p>At last the day arrived when they were
to take the train for Vermont. Their
trunk was carefully packed, and they were
as clean and fresh as Mother's loving
hands could make them.</p>

<p>It was a long ride, but there was so
much to see every minute that the time
passed quickly. At noon they opened
the box of lunch Mother had put up for
them. When they saw the sandwiches
and the little cakes and apple turnovers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
there was a lump in their throats for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>The conductor came along just then, to
tell them they were crossing the Connecticut,
and in their eagerness to catch their
first glimpse of the great river they forgot
all about being homesick.</p>

<p>Uncle Joe met them at the station. He
gave them each a hearty hand-shake and
a big hug. Then he lifted them up on the
seat of a wagon, and put their trunk in
behind, with ever so many other boxes
and bundles.</p>

<p>It was not far to the shore of the little
lake. Uncle Joe soon had all the provisions
stowed away in a large flat-bottomed
boat, and it did not take long to row across
to the tents on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Do you suppose a supper ever tasted
better to hungry boys than that one of
fried trout just caught from the lake,
with bread and butter, and fresh berries
and cream? Uncle Joe served them generously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
too,&mdash;just as if he knew all about
a boy's appetite!</p>

<p>After supper they were so tired with all
the excitement of the day that they were
content to sit quietly on the little sandy
beach, watching the sunset and the changing
colors in the clouds. There were lovely
shadows on the purple hills, and dim
reflections of the trees and sky in the
smooth surface of the lake. How much
better it was than all the noise and confusion
of the city streets!</p>

<p>It was not long before the boys were
sleepy, and Uncle Joe went with them to
see that everything was all right in their
tent. When they saw the bed they were
a little uncertain as to whether they would
like it. It was nothing but a great heap of
fir-balsam boughs, covered over with two
heavy blankets, and it didn't look very
comfortable; but when they had tried it
a few moments the boys pronounced it the
softest, sweetest bed they ever slept in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Morning found them rested and ready
for camp life. Uncle Joe took them out
fishing, and let them row the boat home.
Then they put on their bathing suits and
he gave them a swimming-lesson. After
dinner they went for a long walk and he
taught them to watch for birds and
squirrels.</p>

<p>They had never dreamed that the woods
could be half so interesting, or hold so
many different things. They enjoyed
every minute of the day; and the next
day, and the next, it was just the same.
They never had to stop and ask, "What
shall we do now?" There was always something
to do, even before they had time to
do it.</p>

<p>They met several other boys, about
their own age, who were living in a camp
farther up the lake. These boys often
joined them in their picnics and excursions,
and the time was too short for all
they found to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>But they did one thing that came very
near spoiling the fun of that happy vacation
in the woods.</p>

<p>One night Uncle Joe stayed out fishing
a little later than usual, leaving his nephews
alone in the camp. The other boys came
down to visit them, and one of them suggested
that it would be great fun to build a
camp-fire.</p>

<p>Dean, who was always a cautious lad,
feared it was not just the right thing to
do, without his uncle's permission; but
at last he gave in to the other boys.</p>

<p>Broken boughs and bark were quickly
piled up, a match was lighted to kindle
the fire, and in a few minutes the flames
were leaping over the dry wood. The
boys were delighted with their bonfire,
and they ran here and there among
the trees collecting more fuel for the
flames.</p>

<p>Suddenly they began to realize that the
fire was spreading. It had run along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
through the dry grass and pine needles,
and the wind was blowing it straight
toward the woods, where they had had
so many good times, and where their
friends the birds and squirrels had their
homes.</p>

<p>At first the boys thought they could
put out the fire with pails of water; but
they soon saw that it was beyond their
control, and they stood still, too frightened
to do anything but scream.</p>

<p>Their cries brought Uncle Joe, and
some fishermen from the other camps, to
fight the fire, and for more than an hour
the men worked valiantly. They chopped
off great green branches and beat out the
flames, they threw on buckets of sand
from the beach, they chopped down trees
and made a broad path in front of the fire,
and finally they dug a trench to keep it
from running along the grass.</p>

<p>At last the fire was declared to be all
out; but it was not until the men's hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
were blistered, and their faces burned and
blackened with the smoke. This was not
the worst of it, however, for nearly an
acre of valuable timber had been destroyed,
and the dead trees held out their
stiff leafless branches like ghosts of the
beautiful pines and firs that had stood
there in the sunshine that very day.</p>

<p>The boys went back to their camps
very soberly. How their hearts ached at
the mischief they had done! They could
think of nothing, talk of nothing, but the
fire. Dean and Gordon sobbed themselves
to sleep, feeling sure that Uncle
Joe would send them both home in the
morning.</p>

<p>But the next day good, kind Uncle Joe,
whom everyone loved, called the boys
around him and gave them a long talk
about forest fires.</p>

<p>He told them he hoped this experience
would teach them never to build a fire
anywhere unless men were near to guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
it carefully, and not even then if the grass
were very dry, or there was the least
breath of wind to carry the flames and
sparks.</p>

<p>He explained that thousands of dollars'
worth of property might have been destroyed,
and possibly lives might have
been lost by their carelessness. He told
them stories of the terrible forest fires
that have raged for days in the timber
lands of the Northwest. When at last
he asked for their promises, the boys gave
them readily, for they had learned how
very dangerous a fire can be; and for the
rest of that summer, at least, there wasn't
another bonfire at Silver Lake.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did Dean hesitate to start a fire
when his uncle was away?</i></p>

<p><i>If the boughs had been green or wet would
they have burned as quickly?</i></p>

<p><i>Did you ever see a fire in the grass or
woods, running along like a race-horse?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><i>How do you think these fires are started?</i></p>

<p><i>Why are fires most dangerous in the
summer and fall?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Forest fires are started from bonfires,
by hunters, campers, fishermen, or lumbermen,
or by mischievous and careless
persons. Fires should never be started
unless the ground is cleared around them,
and at a safe distance from any building
or woods. They should never be left
unguarded.</p>

<p>Forest fires have become so serious that
many states have appointed Fire Wardens,
whose duty it is to patrol the forests.</p>

<p>Watch towers have been erected, from
which observations are taken, and in case
of fire, alarm is spread by means of a
telephone system.</p>

<p>In some countries avenues, equal in
width to the height of the tallest tree,
are cut through the forests at intervals of
half a mile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>These avenues afford a fire-barrier and
standing ground for the firemen to fight
the flames.</p>

<p>With the many acres of valuable timber
destroyed by fire every year, and the
indiscriminate cutting of trees by the
lumbermen, our forests are fast disappearing.
Children should be encouraged
to observe Arbor Day, and to plant trees,
so that the custom may become more
general, and the forests be renewed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THELMA'S BIRTHDAY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Thelma</span> was a little Fourth-of-July
girl,&mdash;at least that was what her
father always called her, for her
birthday came on the glorious Fourth,
the day to which all the children in the
United States look forward, just as they
do to Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

<p>Thelma did not have any brothers or
sisters, but she had ever so many friends
and playmates; and besides, there was
Rover,&mdash;the best playmate of all,&mdash;good,
kind, loving Rover, who followed his little
mistress like a shadow all day long.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July was Rover's birthday,
too; but he never looked forward to
it with the least bit of pleasure. When
the horns were tooting, the bells were
ringing, and the fire-crackers were snapping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
you would always find Rover under
Thelma's bed, with his head on his paws,
and his eyes shut tight. I believe he would
have put cotton in his ears, too, if he had
only known that it would help to keep out
the dreadful noise.</p>

<p>Of course no one had ever told Rover
about the Fourth of July, and he didn't
understand at all why bells were rung
and cannon were fired, and why everyone
was eager to celebrate the day.</p>

<p>But Thelma knew all about it. She was
eleven years old, and she had often read
the story in her reading-books at school.
When her father took her on his knee,
and helped her a little now and then with
questions, she told just how it happened.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "when the white
men first came to this country they formed
thirteen colonies; but they were ruled by
the King of England, who often treated
them unjustly.</p>

<p>"They bore their troubles patiently for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a long time, but finally they were forced
to pay such heavy taxes that they rebelled.
Then they decided to break away from
English rule and be free and independent
states.</p>

<p>"Thomas Jefferson wrote a paper declaring
their independence, and men from
each of the thirteen colonies signed it.
This paper was called the 'Declaration
of Independence,' and it was read from
the balcony of the State House in Philadelphia,
before a great crowd of people, on
July 4, 1776.</p>

<p>"Bells were rung to spread the good
news, and ever since that time the Fourth
of July has been celebrated as the birthday
of the United States of America."</p>

<p>"And what shall we do this year to
celebrate all these birthdays?" her father
asked, when Thelma finished her story.</p>

<p>"Let's give a party," replied the little
girl, and she jumped up to make out the
list of friends she wished to invite.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">The Flying Squadron</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>One morning about a week later Rover
waked up very early. He slept at night
in his kennel behind the barn, and he
always kept one ear open so that he could
hear the least little bit of noise. But it
was not a little noise that waked him this
time.</p>

<p>"Bang, bang! Crack, crack! Toot,
toot! Ding, dong!" he heard from every
direction.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" thought Rover, "I wonder
if this is the Fourth of July! It can't be a
year since I heard that noise before."
But he did not have to wonder long. A
crowd of boys were coming down the street,
blowing horns, drumming on tin pans and
firing off torpedoes. They threw a fire-cracker
into Rover's yard, and it exploded
in front of his kennel.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said to himself, as the
smoke drifted away in a little cloud; "it
is the Fourth of July, after all."</p>

<p>The minute the cook opened the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
door he pattered up the back stairs to
spend the day under Thelma's bed. His
little mistress went two or three times to
coax him to play with her; but he wouldn't
even come out to eat his dinner, and when
her friends began to arrive for the party
she forgot all about him.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening, and after
supper the children played games on the
lawn. It seemed to them that it would
never be dark enough for the fireworks.</p>

<p>"I wish the Fourth of July came in
December," said one of the boys. "It is
always dark by five o'clock when we want
to go skating after school."</p>

<p>At last it began to grow dark, and Mr.
Ward lighted the Japanese lanterns around
the broad piazza, and brought out two
big boxes of fireworks.</p>

<p>"You children may sit on the steps where
you can't get into any mischief," he said.
"I will set off the fireworks on the lawn,
and then we will have a feast in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
summer-house. I saw a man walking
down that way with some ice-cream a
little while ago."</p>

<p>But even ice-cream was not so tempting
as the fireworks, and for an hour the children
sat on the steps, watching the pinwheels
and Roman candles and red lights
that Mr. Ward set off, with two of the
older boys to help him.</p>

<p>"O-o-o-oh!" they cried, every time a
sky-rocket went whizzing up over the
trees to burst into a hundred shining stars;
and "A-a-a-ah!" they shouted, when tiny
lights like fireflies went flitting across the
lawn.</p>

<p>The last thing of all was a fire-balloon,
and Mr. Ward called the children down to
the lawn to watch it fill with hot air from
the burning candle in its base.</p>

<p>It filled very slowly, and the children
were so quiet that Rover came creeping
down the stairs to see if the noise were all
over for another year.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>At last the balloon rose slowly above
the children's heads. "There it goes!"
they cried. "Watch it, now! Watch it!"
and they ran along with it as it sailed across
the lawn.</p>

<p>A puff of wind blew it lightly toward the
house. Then another breeze caught it
and carried it over the roof of the barn.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" the children shouted.
"It is going higher. Now it will sail away
over the trees."</p>

<p>But suddenly a gust of wind turned the
balloon completely over. The tissue paper
caught fire from the burning candle, and
the blazing mass dropped down behind the
barn.</p>

<p>"It will set fire to the summer-house!"
shouted Mr. Ward.</p>

<p>"And melt the ice-cream," cried the
children, as they followed him across the
lawn.</p>

<p>There had been very little rain for a
month, and the roof of the summer-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
was so dry that it caught fire almost instantly
from the blazing paper. Mr.
Ward and some of the boys brought pails
of water and tried to put out the flames;
but the little house and Rover's kennel
were burned to the ground, in spite of all
their efforts.</p>

<p>When the fire was out and the children
had gone home without their ice-cream,
Mr. Ward said to his wife, "That is the
very last time I shall ever send up a fire-balloon.
Fireworks are dangerous enough,
but a fire-balloon is worse. I believe the
sale of them should be forbidden by law,
if men haven't sense enough not to buy
them."</p>

<p>But Rover, who was sleeping comfortably
on the rug outside Thelma's door,
cocked up his ears at the mention of
fire-balloons. "They don't make any
noise," he said to himself, "and I like
this bed much better than the straw in
my kennel."</p>

<p>Every year the celebration of the Fourth
of July costs thousands of dollars in the
destruction of property by fire, to say
nothing of the loss of life from the accidental
or careless discharge of fireworks.
One of the causes of fires on this day is
the fire-balloons. They are easily swayed
by currents of air, and the lighted candles
set fire to the tissue paper of which the
balloon is made. The blazing paper falls
upon the roofs of buildings, frequently
causing serious fires.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>Almost all fireworks are dangerous play-things,
and should be handled with great
caution. In many states there are laws
regulating the sale and use of fireworks,
and all over the country there is now a
general movement toward a saner and
safer Fourth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE "E. V. I. S."</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright, beautiful afternoon in
April. The air was soft and spring-like,
and the sky as blue as only April
skies can be.</p>

<p>The grass was springing up fresh and
green, and the robins and bluebirds were
singing joyously.</p>

<p>Elmwood was a pretty little village.
Its streets were long and level, and there
were so many elms among the shade trees
that Elmwood seemed just the right name
for it.</p>

<p>The village school had just been dismissed,
and the street was full of boys
and girls who were hurrying home to their
dinner; but over in one corner of the
campus a group of boys were talking
together earnestly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"I say, boys, we must do it!" exclaimed
the tallest in the group.</p>

<p>"Of course we must," echoed one of the
younger boys.</p>

<p>"It will be great fun!" and "Won't we
make things look fine!" shouted two of
the others. And so they talked on, in
eager boyish voices, making plans for the
Village Improvement Society which they
wished to form.</p>

<p>They had already talked the matter
over with their teachers and parents, and
everyone encouraged them to go ahead.
"We will help and advise you all we can,"
they said; "and it is just the time of year
when there is plenty to do about the town."</p>

<p>That evening the boys held a meeting
to elect officers and plan their work. Mr.
Ashley, the principal of the school, was
invited to come, and promptly at eight
o'clock the Elmwood Village Improvement
Society was formed. Leon Messenger
was chosen president, Archie Hazen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was made secretary, and Harold Merrill
treasurer.</p>

<p>Each and every one promised to do his
part and to work with a will to improve
the little village of Elmwood; and, with
Mr. Ashley's advice, they planned their
work for the summer.</p>

<p>First of all, they decided, the streets
must be cleaned. That alone would require
a good deal of time.</p>

<p>Then some one proposed raking the
yards for three or four poor women.
"They can't afford to hire it done.
Couldn't we do it for them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Good work!" responded Mr. Ashley.
"Then, boys, see if you can't get permission
to tear down and remove some
old fences. Their owners would probably
make no objection to your doing it, and it
would be a great improvement to the
village."</p>

<p>There were two triangles of land between
cross streets. Here the boys planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to plant cannas and other bulbs, and to
keep the grass neatly mowed around the
beds.</p>

<p>"We might set out some vines to
clamber over the telephone poles," one
boy suggested.</p>

<p>"Some of us must go about and get the
people to give money to buy waste-barrels,"
said Archie Hazen. "We must
never allow paper, banana and orange
peels, or anything of that kind on the
streets."</p>

<p>"Better still, we must never throw them
there ourselves," added Harold Merrill.</p>

<p>"Those of us who drive cows must look
out that they do not feed beside the road,"
said Leon Messenger; "and we might get
our fathers to trim up the trees."</p>

<p>"We must be sure to see some of the
town officers about having no more rubbish
dumped over the river-bank," said
another.</p>

<p>"We'll have our campus look better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
than it ever did before," declared one of
the little boys; while another added,
"We'll have Elmwood the cleanest, prettiest
village in all New England."</p>

<p>The boys not only planned,&mdash;they
worked, and worked with a will. The
very next day was Saturday, and every
member of the new E. V. I. S. was on hand
to do his best.</p>

<p>Never had the streets of Elmwood
looked so clean as they did in one week's
time. Many a poor woman's yard was
carefully raked, and several old fences
were removed.</p>

<p>Money for the waste-barrels had been
given cheerfully, and all the boys were so
eager to keep the streets clean that they
would not have thrown a paper bag or a
banana-skin in the road any more than
they would have thrown it on their mother's
carpet.</p>

<p>The raking of so many streets and yards,
and the tearing down of fences, made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
good deal of rubbish. The boys carted it
a little way outside of the village, and left
it there to dry, so that they could have a
bonfire.</p>

<p>One warm night in May, Leon Messenger
called the club together after school.
"We can have our bonfire to-night," he
said. "There has been no rain for a week
and it ought to burn splendidly. Let's
all be on hand by eight o'clock."</p>

<p>Shouts of "Sure!" and "Hurrah!" were
the answer; and the boys were all on hand
in good season that evening.</p>

<p>The fence rails made a fine foundation,
and the boys built them up in log-cabin
style. Then they threw on old boxes,
barrels, and rubbish until they had an
enormous pile.</p>

<p>"Now let's finish off with some dry fir
boughs," suggested Harold. "They will
send the sparks up like rockets."</p>

<p>When everything was ready, kerosene
was poured over the brush, and a lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
match soon set the fire blazing merrily.
Then how the boys did shout! They
danced around the fire, whooping and
singing, and pretending they were Indians
having a war-dance.</p>

<p>When at last the fire died down, they
found some long sticks and poked the
embers to make the sparks fly again, and
then they sat down around the glowing
ashes and watched the little flames flicker
out. Finally they all decided that there
could be no danger in leaving their bonfire.</p>

<p>"Well," said Archie Hazen, "there
seems to be some fun for the E. V. I. S.
after all. Let's give three rousing cheers
and then go home to bed."</p>

<p>The three cheers were given with a will.
Then the boys bade each other good-night
and set off for home.</p>

<p>When everything was quiet and the
whole village was asleep, North Wind took
his turn at building a fire. He puffed out
his cheeks and blew on the red embers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
until tiny flames came darting out to lick
the dry leaves.</p>

<p>He sent merry little breezes to toss the
hot sparks into the grass, and when it
blazed up, here and there, he blew with all
his might and swept the fire across the field.</p>

<p>Just beyond the fence stood an old,
tumble-down barn, and it was not long
before the fire was raging and roaring its
way to the very roof. The blaze lighted
the sky and wakened the village folk from
their sleep.</p>

<p>Men and boys tumbled out of bed and
hurried through the streets with buckets
of water. The firemen came out with
their hose and ladders; but it was too late,&mdash;the
old barn was gone.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were no other buildings
near by, so little damage was done;
but it taught the boys a good lesson. They
had a meeting the very next morning,
and agreed never to leave a fire again
until the last spark was burned out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
never to build another bonfire without
first raking the leaves and dry grass carefully
away before lighting the fire.</p>

<p>"But it did improve the looks of the
village to burn down that old barn,"
Leon told Archie, when they were walking
home from school together. "We
really ought to add old North Wind to our
list of members of the E. V. I. S."</p>

<p><i>What was the object of this society?</i></p>

<p><i>What was the result of their work?</i></p>

<p><i>What was done with the rubbish?</i></p>

<p><i>What lesson did it teach?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The burning of dry grass, leaves, and
rubbish in bonfires, in the spring or fall,
is a common practice. Extreme care
should be used that it is done at a safe
distance from buildings and woods, and it
should be constantly watched, as a breeze
may fan the flames and cause the spread
of the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOREST FIRES</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> loss by forest fires in the
United States for the month of October,
1910, was about $14,600,000.</p>

<p>Thousands of acres of valuable timber
were destroyed, leaving in the place of
beautiful green forests nothing but a
dreary waste of black stumps and fallen
trunks.</p>

<p>This was an unusually heavy loss for a
single month; but in the spring and fall
of every year, especially in times of drought,
fires sometimes rage for days through our
splendid forests.</p>

<p>These fires are more frequent and disastrous
in Minnesota, Michigan, New
York, and eastern Maine; but, in 1910,
twenty-eight different states suffered heavy
loss among their timber lands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>The causes of these fires are chiefly
sparks from engines or sawmills, campfires,
burning brush, careless smokers, and
lightning. More than two-thirds of the
fires are due to thoughtlessness and ignorance,
and could be prevented. Even in
the case of a fire set by lightning, which
seems purely accidental, the fire would not
occur if fallen trees and dead underbrush
were cleared away, for lightning never
ignites green wood.</p>

<p>In one year there were three hundred
fires among the Adirondack Mountains of
New York, one hundred and twenty-one of
which were due to sparks from the engines
of passing trains. Eighty-eight were traced
to piles of leaves left burning, twenty-nine
to camp fires, and six to cigar-stubs
and burning tobacco from pipes.</p>

<p>Every fire, when it first starts, is nothing
but a little blaze which might easily be
extinguished; but as it grows and spreads
it quickly gets beyond control, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
there is a force of well-trained men to
fight it.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of forest fires,&mdash;"top
fires," "ground fires," and the fires
which burn the whole trees and leave
nothing standing but stumps and blackened
trunks.</p>

<p>The "top fire" is a fire in the tops of the
trees. It is usually caused by a spark
from an engine dropping on a dry twig or
cone among the upper branches. A light
breeze will then blow the fire from one
tree to another high up in the air, and
after it has swept through the forest and
killed the tops, the trees will die. This is
the hardest kind of a fire to fight, as it is
impossible to reach it. The only thing to
do is to cut a lane in the forest too wide
for the flames to leap across; but there is
not always time for this, as the fire travels
rapidly.</p>

<p>The ground fire is not so difficult to cut
off, as it spreads through the moss and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the decaying vegetable matter among the
roots of the trees. A broad furrow of
fresh earth, turned up with a plow, or dug
up with a spade, will stop the progress of
the fire; but this kind of fire is especially
treacherous, as it will live for days, or
even weeks, smouldering in a slow-burning
log or in a bed of closely-packed pine
needles, and then burst out with renewed
vigor.</p>

<p>As all large fires create air currents,
masses of light gas, like large bubbles or
balloons, are blown about in the air, ready
to burst into flame from even a tiny spark.
In this way new and mysterious fires are
set, often at some distance from the original
fire.</p>

<p>An ordinary forest fire travels slowly
unless it is fanned by strong winds or driven
by a hurricane. It will burn up-hill much
faster than it burns down-hill, as the
flames, and the drafts they create, sweep
upward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>The noise from one of these great fires
is terrifying. The flames roar with a voice
like thunder, and the fallen trees crash to
the ground, bringing down other trees
with them.</p>

<p>Birds and wild animals flee before the
fire, hurrying away to a place of safety.
They seem to know by instinct which way
to go, and deer, bears, coyotes, mountain
sheep, and mountain lions will follow along
the same trail without fear of each other
in their common danger.</p>

<p>Some of our national forests, and some
of the tracts of timber land owned by
big lumber companies, are guarded by
forest rangers and fire patrols, and many
fires are put out before they do serious
damage, by the quick thought and skilled
work of these men and their helpers.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that forest fires
in the United States destroy property to
the value of $50,000,000 every year. In
this way the timber in the country is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
rapidly exhausted; and unless something
is done to put a stop to this waste and to
replenish the supply by planting new
forests, there will be little timber left in
another fifty years.</p>

<p>It is impossible to realize the extent to
which our forests have been destroyed
unless one travels through these great
barren wastes. To ride in a railway train
for hundreds of miles through northern
Michigan and Minnesota, seeing nothing
but stumps, like tombstones of what were
once magnificent trees, and short dead
trunks, like sentinels on a battle-field,
is a sad and depressing sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PINCH AND TEDDY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Pinch</span> was a tiny terrier pup when
we first brought him home to live
with us. He was a plump, round,
little fellow, with long, silvery-gray hair.
His ears were so soft and silky that every
one admired them, and his eyes were as
bright as buttons, when we could get a
glimpse of them. But the hair hung over
them so long that we did not see them
very often.</p>

<p>As he grew older we had him clipped
every summer. Then he was much more
comfortable; and he looked prettier, too,
for his coat was as smooth and shining as
a piece of satin. The hair over his eyes
was never cut; if it were, he could not see
so well. This hair was needed to protect
his eyes from the strong sunlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Pinch was a very aristocratic little dog.
He did not like to play with any one whose
manners were not good.</p>

<p>Sometimes a street dog would come up
to him, with a friendly air, and say,
"Good morning, wouldn't you like to play
with me for a while?"</p>

<p>But Pinch always tossed his nose in the
air and walked away very proudly, saying,
"No, I thank you, not to-day."</p>

<p>This often made the poor street dog feel
a little hurt; but he would wag his tail
and run away to his old playmates.
"Don't ever try to have anything to do
with aristocratic Pinch," he would tell
them, in dog language. "He feels too fine
for us. I shall never give him a chance to
snub me again."</p>

<p>Pinch liked the softest cushions to lie
on, and the daintiest things to eat. He
was very fond of his mistress and liked to
have her feed him; but he never liked to
eat from a dish. He preferred to have her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
break his food in tiny pieces and feed it
to him from her hand.</p>

<p>He had a little bed of his own on the
floor, but he liked the soft down puff on
the guest-room bed much better, and he
often stole away to take a nap there.</p>

<p>Pinch had one very bad habit. He
always barked when any one rang the
door-bell, and no one but his master could
stop him. His mistress often tried to
quiet him; but Pinch would look up at
her with merry eyes which seemed to say,
"I'm not a bit afraid of you. I know you
love me too well to punish me." And he
kept right on barking.</p>

<p>He liked to go for a walk with any
member of the family, and if he were
left at home alone, he would sit down
beside the door and cry as if his little
doggish heart would break. If his master's
automobile stopped in front of the house,
he would run out and jump up in the front
seat, wagging his little stump of a tail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"I don't mean to be left at home this
time," he seemed to be saying; but he
would look anxiously at his mistress until
she said, "Yes, Pinch, you may go." Then
he would fairly dance up and down in his
excitement.</p>

<p>One afternoon Pinch came into the
house, sniffing about as usual. Suddenly,
to his surprise, he came upon a half-grown
kitten curled up comfortably under the
kitchen stove. The kitten was fat and
black, and he had a pretty pink nose and
a long tail with a tiny white tip. Yes,
and he had roguish-looking eyes, too.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what are you doing
here?" asked Pinch, bristling up angrily.</p>

<p>"My name is Teddy, and I have come
to live in this house," the kitten answered
politely.</p>

<p>Pinch looked Teddy over scornfully and
was not very cordial. He walked away
muttering to himself, "I do hope that
saucy black kitten doesn't expect me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
chum with him. I don't see why my
mistress wants a kitten anyway. I am
pet enough for one family."</p>

<p>Pinch was really jealous of the poor
little kitten; but Teddy was so bright
and good-natured that he couldn't help
playing with him sometimes, especially if
no one was there to see him; but he
couldn't bear to see his mistress pet the
cat.</p>

<p>"Here I am," he would say; "don't
talk to that cat. Talk to me."</p>

<p>Then he would chase Teddy all over the
house, until at last Teddy would turn and
box his ears, and that was the end of the
game for that day.</p>

<p>Teddy had a funny little trick of jumping
up on the sideboard. Perhaps he
liked to look at himself in the mirror.
Once, when he was playing with Pinch,
he jumped up in such a hurry that he
knocked off a glass dish and broke it all
to pieces. He was so frightened at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
noise that he did not get up there again
for a long time; but he did sit on the chairs
and tables, and even on the beds and
bureaus. In fact, he made himself at
home almost anywhere.</p>

<p>He was very playful, too, so his mistress
gave him a soft ball and a little woolly
chicken. He kept them under the book-case
in the library, and whenever he
wanted a game of ball he pulled them out
and played with them for a while.</p>

<p>Sometimes he played with his own tail,
chasing it round and round, and twisting
himself up double in his excitement. He
played with the curtain tassels, too, and
with the corner of the tablecloth; but his
mistress always scolded him if she caught
him at it.</p>

<p>One evening, just before supper, the
whole family was up stairs, and Pinch and
Teddy were having a very lively frolic
in the dining-room. Suddenly there was
a great crash, and the cat and dog went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
flying through the hall to hide under the
sofa in the parlor.</p>

<p>The cook came running in from the
kitchen, and down stairs rushed the whole
family to see what was the matter. There
was matter enough, you may be sure, for
Teddy had jumped at the table, missed his
footing, and pulled off the cloth with all
the dishes and a lighted lamp.</p>

<p>The lamp broke as it fell to the floor,
and the burning oil was already spreading
over the carpet.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire!" cried the excited children.</p>

<p>"Water! Water!" screamed the cook,
and she ran back to the kitchen to catch
up a pail.</p>

<p>"Don't pour water on that blazing oil,"
shouted the master of the house. "Bring
some flour. Quick!"</p>

<p>The children ran to the pantry, and the
cook dipped up big panfuls of flour, which
they carried to the dining-room and threw
over the fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>The room was filled with a thick, black
smoke, and every one coughed and choked;
their eyes began to smart, and tears ran
down their cheeks; but they worked
bravely, and after a few minutes the last
tiny flame was extinguished.</p>

<p>"What a queer way to put out a fire!"
said one of the boys, after the excitement
was all over. "I thought everyone always
used water."</p>

<p>"Not when the fire is caused by burning
oil," replied his father. "Water will only
spread the oil, and make a bad matter
worse. Always remember to use flour or
sand to smother the flames, if a lamp
explodes or is tipped over."</p>

<p>"There is something else we should remember,"
added his wife; "and that is,
never to leave a lighted lamp on the table
when there is no one in the room."</p>

<p>Pinch and Teddy had something to remember,
too. The noise of the falling
china and the sight of the blazing oil had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
sent them scurrying under the couch in
the parlor; and although they had many
another good frolic, Teddy never jumped
up on the table again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Who was Pinch? Who was Teddy?</i></p>

<p><i>Where did Teddy like to sleep?</i></p>

<p><i>How did he pull the cloth off the table?</i></p>

<p><i>What harm did it do?</i></p>

<p><i>Why should a cat never be allowed to jump
on a table?</i></p>

<p><i>What other animals do you know of that
have set fires by accident?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Great care should be taken to prevent
children and pet animals from setting
fires. Many a cat or dog has tipped over
a lamp and set the house on fire.</p>

<p>It is safer to place the lamp on a shelf
or bracket. Never set it on a table which
is covered with a cloth that hangs over
the edge, as the cloth might accidentally
be pulled off, bringing the lamp with it.</p>

<p>Hanging lamps should be used with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
caution, as the heat may melt the solder
in the chain, thus weakening the links
and allowing the lighted lamp to fall upon
the table or floor.</p>

<p>A lantern should always be hung up,
especially in the barn or stable. It should
never be set on the floor where it could
easily be tipped over, or where it might
be kicked over by a cow or horse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BUSY BEES</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Everyone</span> in the neighborhood
called the Belchers the "Busy Bees;"
in fact, they had been called by
this name so long that they had almost
forgotten their real name.</p>

<p>When the children went out on the
street together, the neighbors would say,
"There go the Busy Bees;" and if any one
wanted a book from the library, or a spool
of thread from the corner store, some one
was sure to suggest, "Ask one of the Busy
Bees to get it for you."</p>

<p>Father Busy Bee had died several years
ago. That meant that Mother Busy Bee
and the young Bees must work all the
harder to keep their home together.</p>

<p>Beatrice, the oldest daughter, was seventeen
years old, and almost ready to graduate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
from the High School. Bradley was
a messenger boy at the telegraph office,
Burton worked in a green-house on Saturdays
and holidays; and Little Barbara,
who was only eight years old, earned a
good many pennies by running on errands
for the next-door neighbors.</p>

<p>Mother Busy Bee was a good nurse,
and whenever she could possibly spare
time from her children, she left Beatrice to
keep the house while she went to take care
of any one who was sick and needed her.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a busier family
anywhere, and as every one of their names
began with "B," it was hardly surprising
that people called them the "Busy Bees."
Perhaps they were all the happier for
being so busy, for they had no time for
quarreling or getting into mischief; and
when they did have a few minutes for
play, they thought they were the luckiest
children in town, and had the very best
time you can imagine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Of course Mother Busy Bee was always
sorry to leave her children at home alone;
but Beatrice was getting old enough now
to be a pretty good housekeeper, and
Bradley was a manly little fellow who
liked to take care of his brother and sisters.</p>

<p>One night there was an accident at one
of the mills in the town, and several
people were injured. Mother Busy Bee
was sent for in a hurry, and she put on her
hat and coat and got ready to go at once,
talking all the time as she flew around the
house.</p>

<p>"I may be back in an hour, and I may be
gone a week," she said. "Take good care
of each other, and be very careful about
fire. Don't play with the matches, always
set the lamp in the middle of the big table,
and never go out of the house without
looking to see that the drafts of the stove
are all shut tight."</p>

<p>She had said this so many times before
that Bradley couldn't help laughing. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mother!" he exclaimed; "you are always
looking for trouble. We are too old to play
with matches, and we never have set anything
on fire yet."</p>

<p>Just then his mother caught sight of a
pile of schoolbooks on the table, and
another worry slipped into her mind.
"There!" she said, "it is examination
week for you and Bee, and I ought not
to leave you at all. You need to study
every minute."</p>

<p>"Now, Mother," said Beatrice, throwing
her arm around Mrs. Busy Bee and
running with her to the door, "there are
ever so many people in this town who need
you more than we do to-night. Run along,
dear, and don't worry. We'll get along
splendidly. I can get up earlier in the
morning and have plenty of time to study
after the dishes are done. Barbara will
help me, too. She is a big girl now, you
know;" and she drew her little sister up
beside her to give Mother a good-bye kiss.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>So Mrs. Busy Bee hurried down the
stairs to the street door, calling back all
sorts of instructions, and promising to be
home in a day or two at the very most.</p>

<p>But the accident was more serious than
she expected, and at the end of a week she
was still unable to leave her patient's
bedside.</p>

<p>In the meantime Beatrice and Bradley
had found plenty of time for study, and
had taken all their school examinations.
It was a circle of merry faces that gathered
around the supper table each night, even
if Mother were still away and the house so
full of work.</p>

<p>Everything went well until one evening
Beatrice discovered that the doughnut jar
was empty. She knew how much the boys
liked doughnuts for their breakfast, and
as she had often seen her mother make
them, she felt sure she knew just how it
was done.</p>

<p>She set the kettle of fat on the stove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
put the lamp on a shelf out of the way,
rolled up her sleeves and went to work.
But it was not so easy as it had seemed,
and before the doughnuts were rolled out
and cut into round rings, ready to fry,
Beatrice was beginning to wish she hadn't
attempted it.</p>

<p>"I never thought cooking could be such
hard work," she said with a sigh, as she
dropped the first ring into the fat, and
waited for it to rise and turn a lovely
golden brown. But it didn't rise very
quickly, and when it did float leisurely
to the surface, it was still white and
sticky.</p>

<p>"The fat isn't hot enough, I guess,"
she said to herself, and taking up the
kettle by the handle, she lifted the stove-cover
to set the kettle over the coals. But
the kettle was not well balanced on its
handle, and it tipped a little. Some of the
fat spilled over on the hot stove and took
fire. The flames spread quickly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Beatrice's gingham apron blazed up almost
instantly.</p>

<p>The poor girl screamed with fright,
tearing at her apron to get it off, and rushing
to the sitting-room for help.</p>

<p>Bradley looked up and saw her coming.
"Stand still! Stand still!" he shouted,
and catching a heavy afghan from the
couch he threw it over her shoulders, to
protect her face from the flames. Then he
snatched a rug from the floor and wrapped
it tightly around her to smother the fire,
which was beginning to burn her woollen
dress.</p>

<p>Poor Beatrice was badly burned and
terribly frightened. She sobbed and cried,
partly with fear, partly with pain, for her
hands were blistered, and there were
spatters of hot fat on her bare arms; but,
fortunately, the fat on the stove had
burned itself out without setting fire to
the kitchen, and that was something to be
very thankful for, at least.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Bradley made his sister as comfortable
as he knew how, while Burton ran to ask
one of the neighbors what to do for her
burns; but when their mother came home
the next morning, she found a very sober
group of children to greet her. And from
that day to this not one of the Busy
Bees ever wanted another doughnut for
breakfast.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why were the Belchers called "Busy
Bees"?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did Beatrice try to fry some doughnuts?</i></p>

<p><i>How did she set her apron on fire?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did Bradley tell her to stand still?</i></p>

<p><i>How did he smother the flames?</i></p>

<p><i>What lessons do you learn from this
story?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Frying doughnuts, or any other food,
in hot fat is always dangerous, as there
are many ways of setting the fat on fire.
Only an experienced person should attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
it. The kettle should never be more than
two-thirds full of fat. The fat should not
be allowed to boil up, nor to bubble over.
Never put water into fat, nor drop in anything
that has been in water without first
wiping or drying it. Water will always
make hot fat spatter. Great care should
be used in moving the kettle on the stove.
Never raise it or move it without using
two hands, and two holders, one to lift
the handle, the other to steady the side
of the kettle.</p>

<p>Do not use water to put out an oil fire,
as it causes the fire to spread over a greater
surface. Smother the flames with a heavy
rug or coat. If a woman's clothing catches
fire, she should not run through the house,
as running only fans the flames and makes
them burn all the faster. She should wrap
herself in a rug or heavy mat, or roll on
the floor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE COUNTY FAIR</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"Oh,</span> Father, please let me go to the
fair! You promised me I could
a week ago. All the boys are going,
and I just can't give it up. Please
let me go!" and Harry was almost in
tears over his disappointment.</p>

<p>"I know all about it, Harry," his father
answered. "I realize how much you have
looked forward to the fair, and I should
like to have you go. There is a great deal
for a boy to learn at a fair, if he will only
keep his eyes open, but you see just how
it is. I am in bed with a sprained ankle,
and your mother cannot leave the baby.
So what are we to do? A boy of ten is too
young to go to such a place without some
one to look after him."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father; but Roy Bradish is going
with two other boys who are twelve or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
fourteen years old, and they asked me to
go with them. They could take care of
me as well as not. I'd be good, Father.
Please, please let me go!"</p>

<p>Harry begged so hard that at last his
father yielded, and gave the boy permission
to go with his friends.</p>

<p>"I would rather have you go with an
older person," he said; "but there seems
to be no one who can take you. Be very
careful not to get into mischief. Don't
shout, or run about, or do anything to
attract attention. A quiet boy who takes
care of himself is the boy I like to see."</p>

<p>So, on the day of the fair, a warm sunny
day in late September, Harry started off
with his three friends. He had a dollar
in his pocket for spending-money, and a
box under his arm, which was well filled
with sandwiches and doughnuts. As he
bade good-bye to his father and mother,
he promised over and over to be good,
and to come home before dark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>It was a long walk to the grounds where
the fair was held every year, but the boys
trudged along, talking and laughing, and
having a good time.</p>

<p>At the entrance-gate Harry spent half
of his dollar for a ticket, and it was not
long before the other half was gone, for
there were many things to tempt money
from a boy's pocket. He bought peanuts
and pop-corn and a cane for himself, an
apple-corer for his mother, and a whet-stone
for his father.</p>

<p>The other boys spent their money, too;
and then they wandered around in the
grounds, going into first one building and
then another. There were exhibitions of
vegetables and fruit in one building,&mdash;great
piles of squashes and pumpkins;
boxes of onions, turnips, beets, carrots,
and parsnips; ears of yellow corn with
their husks braided together, and corn-stalks
ten or twelve feet tall ranged against
the wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="captionsmall">From Stereograph, Copyright, 1905, by Underwood &amp; Underwood, N. Y.</p>

<p class="caption">The horses are led away to a place of safety</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>The fruit was displayed on long tables
in the center of the room,&mdash;rosy-cheeked
apples, luscious golden pears, velvety
peaches, and great clusters of purple grapes.
It was enough to make one's mouth water
just to look at them.</p>

<p>But the animal-sheds were even more
interesting. There were handsome horses,&mdash;black,
bay, and chestnut. Their coats
shone like satin; and when their keepers
led them out they arched their necks and
pranced about, as if they were trying to
say, "Did you ever see a more beautiful
creature than I am? Just wait a while,
and I will race for you. See all these blue
ribbons! I won them by my beauty and
my speed."</p>

<p>Then there were the cattle, long rows of
them, standing patiently in their narrow
stalls; the pigs, little ones and big ones,
white ones and black ones; and the sheep
with their long coats of warm, soft wool.</p>

<p>After the boys had eaten their lunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they watched the horse-show for a little
while, and then there was a free circus
which they wanted to see, so it was the
middle of the afternoon before they found
their way to the poultry show.</p>

<p>Such a noise you never heard in all your
life as the one that greeted their ears the
moment they stepped inside the door.
If you want to hear some queer music,
just listen to a poultry band at a county
fair,&mdash;roosters crowing, hens cackling,
ducks quacking, pigeons cooing, and turkeys
gobbling.</p>

<p>Harry liked the poultry-show best of all.
He had some hens at home which he had
raised himself, and he stood for a long time
watching a mother hen and her tiny
bantam chickens.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't spent all my money,"
he said to himself. "I'd like to buy two
or three of those chickens."</p>

<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" said a loud voice
in a cage behind him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Harry turned quickly, and there stood a
handsome white rooster, flapping his wings
and crowing lustily.</p>

<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" he said again,
and he walked back and forth in the narrow
cage, strutting proudly, and spreading his
wings as if to say, "What do you think
of me?"</p>

<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo! I'd like to buy
you, too," said Harry.</p>

<p>"He is a beauty, isn't he, Roy?" he
added, turning to speak to his friend.
But the boys were gone. He walked the
whole length of the building, and they were
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have gone back to the
sheep-pens," he said to himself, and he ran
across the grounds to look for them.</p>

<p>The judges were awarding prizes for the
finest sheep, and the long low building
was crowded with people, but there was
no sign of Harry's friends.</p>

<p>"Where can they be?" he said, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
aloud. "They may have gone over to
see the cows milked by machinery. I'll
go there next."</p>

<p>Just as he went out of the farther door
of the sheep-shed he met two men coming
in. One of the men was smoking, and as
he entered the shed he threw away the
short end of his cigar. It fell in the dry
grass near a pile of straw.</p>

<p>In a minute West Wind came scurrying
across the field, and it was not long before
he found the lighted cigar.</p>

<p>"What are you doing down there in the
grass?" said West Wind. "Why don't you
burn and have a good smoke by yourself?"</p>

<p>The red tip of the cigar shone brighter
at the words. "So I will," it said, and it
sent up a thin curl of blue smoke.</p>

<p>"Pouf! pouf!" said West Wind. "Can't
you do better than that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can," and the stub burned
still brighter.</p>

<p>"Now I'll show you a good smoke,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
said West Wind, and he blew some dry
grass over the cigar.</p>

<p>The grass blazed up and set fire to the
straw, and then there was some smoke,&mdash;you
may be sure!</p>

<p>West Wind danced over the grass with
glee. He whirled round and round, tossing
fresh straw to the flames, and blowing up
the smoke in soft clouds.</p>

<p>In a little while Harry came back, still
hunting for his friends. A puff of smoke
caught his eye and he ran to see what was
burning. By this time the straw had set
fire to the end of the sheep-shed, and the
flames were eating their way toward the
low roof.</p>

<p>"Fire!" shouted Harry; but the crowd
had gone over to see the milking and there
was no one in sight.</p>

<p>"Some one will come in a minute," he
thought, and he snatched off his coat and
beat back the flames as they ran up the
dry boards.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"Fire!" he shouted again, at the top
of his voice. This time a man who was
feeding the lambs heard him and came out
with a pail of water; and then it did not
take long to put out the fire.</p>

<p>Just as Harry was stamping out the
last flickering flames in the burning straw,
a policeman came running out. "Here,
what are you doing?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Putting out this fire," replied the
little boy.</p>

<p>"I suppose you started it, too," said
the policeman. "I never saw a boy yet
who could keep out of mischief."</p>

<p>Just then the two men came to the door
of the sheep-shed. "What is the matter?"
they asked.</p>

<p>"This boy says he was putting out a
fire, and I think he must have set it," the
policeman told them.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Harry, "I didn't set the
straw on fire. It was burning when I came
up, and I tried to put it out."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"I was smoking a cigar when I went
into the shed," spoke up one of the men,
"and I threw it away. It must have set
fire to the straw. It was a very careless
thing to do, and if it hadn't been for this
boy we might have had a terrible fire."</p>

<p>Just then Harry thought of his coat.
It was his very best one, and his mother
had told him to be careful of it. He held
it up and looked at it. One sleeve was
scorched, there were two or three holes
in the back, and the whole coat was covered
with straw and dirt.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd had begun to
gather, just as a crowd always gathers
around a policeman, and the story had
to be told all over again.</p>

<p>"He saved my sheep!" said one of the
men.</p>

<p>"And mine, too," added another.</p>

<p>"Let's help him to get a new coat;"
and he took off his hat and began to pass
it around in the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Just then a newspaper reporter came up
with his camera, and, of course, he wanted
to take Harry's picture. When the newspaper
was published next day, there was
the picture, and the whole story of the
ten-year-old boy whose quick thought
and quick work had saved the sheep-shed
and all the valuable sheep from fire.</p>

<p><i>What is exhibited at a County Fair?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is the fair held in the fall?</i></p>

<p><i>What did the boys see at the fair?</i></p>

<p><i>What set the grass on fire?</i></p>

<p><i>How did Harry put out the fire?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is it careless to throw away a lighted cigar?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Lighted cigars thrown carelessly into
dry grass or rubbish have caused many
fires. Burning tobacco shaken from a pipe
is even more dangerous, and a lighted
cigarette is still worse, as some brands of
cigarettes will burn two or three minutes
after they are thrown away. When they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
are thrown from upper windows, they
frequently lodge upon awnings, setting
them on fire. Cigarette and cigar stubs
in the streets sometimes set fire to women's
skirts. Occasionally a man burns his own
clothing by putting a lighted pipe in his
pocket, or he sets the bed-clothing on fire
by smoking in bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">"LITTLE FAULTS"</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Jamie</span> and his mother were talking
together very earnestly. The boy's
face looked cross and impatient,
while his mother's was sad and serious.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham had sent Jamie to the
store to buy a yard of muslin and a spool
of thread. When he gave her back the
change, she counted it, and saw at once
that there were three pennies missing.</p>

<p>If this had been the first time that
Jamie had brought his mother too little
change, she would have thought a mistake
had been made at the store, or that he
had lost the money.</p>

<p>She would have been glad to believe it
now. But after she had questioned him,
she felt sure, by looking into his eyes&mdash;eyes
that did not look back into hers&mdash; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the boy whom she loved, and wished
to trust, had used the pennies to buy something
for himself, and was trying to deceive
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jamie!" she said, "you don't
know how it troubles me to think you
would do such a thing;" and her eyes
filled with tears as she looked into her
son's face.</p>

<p>Jamie really was a little ashamed, but
he didn't like to say so. "Oh, Mother, you
make such a fuss over nothing!" he
answered, turning to look out of the
window. "It was only two or three
pennies! I don't see why you should feel
so badly over such a little thing. What if
I did spend them for something else?"</p>

<p>"I know it is a little thing," his mother
told him. "It isn't the pennies I care
about. I would have given them to you
gladly if you had asked for them; but I
cannot bear to have you take them and
not tell the truth about it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>"It is only a little fault, I know; but
little faults grow into big ones, just as
little boys grow into big men. You must
look out for your little faults now, Jamie,
or you will have big ones when you are a
man. A boy ten years old should know
the difference between right and wrong."</p>

<p>Jamie did not seem as sorry as his
mother wished he were. "You needn't
worry about me," he said, "I'm not
going to get into any trouble;" and he
put on his cap and went out to join his
playmates.</p>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Burnham saw
him on the street with a crowd of boys
who were snow-balling the passers-by.
When he came home that night, she said,
"I wish you would not play with those
boys. They are rough and rude, and I
don't like them. They are not the kind
of friends I want you to choose."</p>

<p>This time Jamie was decidedly cross.
"Why do you find fault with every little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
thing?" he asked. "Can't you trust me
to take care of myself?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to teach you how to do it,"
his mother replied; "and I want you to
help me."</p>

<p>But this lesson seemed to be a hard one
for the boy to learn. It was not many
days before his teacher saw him copying an
example from the paper of a boy who sat
in front of him in school.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, James Burnham?"
Miss Jackson asked quickly. "I
want you to do those examples yourself,
not copy them from some one else. Bring
your paper here at once. I am sorry I
cannot trust you."</p>

<p>Jamie put the paper on the teacher's
desk, and as he did so he said, "I know
how to do the examples. I don't see why
you should care about such a little thing
as that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may seem only a little thing
to you," replied Miss Jackson; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
unless you are an honest boy you will
never be an honest man. Try to do just
what is right every day, or you will get into
serious trouble before you know it."</p>

<p>Five or six years later Miss Jackson was
visiting an Industrial School for boys,
when suddenly she caught sight of a familiar
face.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" she asked the superintendent
who was conducting her over
the buildings, and she pointed to a boy
who was working at a carpenter's bench.</p>

<p>"His name is James Burnham," replied
the superintendent. "He has been here
two or three years, but we are going to
send him home next month. He is a
pretty good boy now."</p>

<p>"He used to go to school to me," said
Miss Jackson. "I think he meant well,
but he was careless about little things,
and didn't always choose the right
friends."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The horses gallop madly down the street</p>

<p>"That was just the trouble," Mr. Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
told her. "He got into the company of
some bad boys, and they led him into all
kinds of mischief. At last they began
setting fires to some of the old barns in
the town; but one night there was a high
wind that blew the sparks to a house near
by, and it was burned to the ground.
Then the police caught the boys, and they
were all sent away to schools like this.
It has been a good lesson for James, and
his mother is proud of his improvement."</p>

<p>"Boys don't realize what a dangerous
thing fire is," said Miss Jackson, as she
turned to go home. "If they only knew
how much property is destroyed by fire
every year, a large part of it through
carelessness, they would be more thoughtful
about starting a tiny blaze that might
so easily become a great conflagration."</p>

<p><i>Into what trouble did they lead him?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did the boys set fire to the old barns?</i></p>

<p>It is against the law to burn a building,
even if it is nothing but an old barn. No
one can tell where a fire will end if it once
gets a good start. Sparks will fly in all
directions, and if there is a high wind they
will blow for a long distance and set fire
to the roofs of other buildings.</p>

<p>A man who willfully sets fire to his own
property, or that of his neighbors, is liable
to imprisonment. Arson is a serious crime
and calls for severe punishment.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TEN YOUNG RATS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Mr.</span> and Mrs. Rat had ten babies.
They were fat, glossy, little fellows,
with long tails and shining
black eyes, and they lived in a snug nest
in the attic.</p>

<p>You can't imagine how hard it was for
their father and mother to find names for
so many children. Mrs. Rat wanted this
name; Mr. Rat preferred that; but they
couldn't agree on a single one. At last
they decided to wait until the babies were
grown up, then they could tell just what
name would suit each one best.</p>

<p>It does not take long for baby rats to
grow up, and in two or three weeks Father
and Mother Rat began to name their
children.</p>

<p>The biggest one was Jumbo, the smallest
they called Tiny. One had a very long tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and he was called Long Tail; another had
almost no tail at all, so he was named
Bobby.</p>

<p>One rat was named Whiskers, because
he had such handsome whiskers, and Spot
had a tiny white spot over one of his eyes.
Then there were Frisky, and Squeaker, and
Listen, and Duncie.</p>

<p>Mother Rat didn't like Duncie's name
at all; but he was so very, very slow and
stupid that Father Rat wouldn't let her
call him anything else.</p>

<p>"We can't expect every one of our ten
children to be smart," he said. "If he
is a dunce we must call him a dunce.
That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Of course all these brothers and sisters
had very jolly times together. They played
tag, and hide-and-seek, and blind-man's
buff, and all sorts of good games; but
sometimes they had dreadful quarrels.
In such a large family there are bound to
be quarrels once in a while.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>When they began to scratch and bite,
Father Rat gave them all a good spanking
and sent them to bed. Then Mother
Rat crept up to tuck them in, with
a big piece of cheese hidden under her
apron.</p>

<p>The children usually obeyed their father
and mother, and tried to be good little
rats; but like all boys and girls they
sometimes thought they knew more than
their parents. Then they got into trouble.</p>

<p>Father Rat had built his nest in the
attic of an old-fashioned farmhouse out in
the country.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Barnes, who lived in the
house, didn't seem to know anything
about the ten young rats in the attic.
Perhaps it was because they were very old
and deaf, and didn't hear the little feet
pattering across the floors and scampering
up and down the walls.</p>

<p>But the ten young rats knew all about
Mr. and Mrs. Barnes. They knew where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Mrs. Barnes kept her cheeses and cookies,
and they gnawed big holes and made good
roads through the walls from the attic to
the pantry and cellar.</p>

<p>They could find their way to the barn,
too, where Mr. Barnes kept his corn and
oats; and sometimes they used to slip
into his hen-house and steal an egg for
their supper.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rat were very thoughtful
about teaching their children. Every
morning there was a long lesson in the
schoolroom corner of the attic. The ten
young rats sat up straight in a row and
did just as they were told.</p>

<p>"Sniff!" said their mother, and they
sniffed their little noses this way and that
to see if they could smell a cat.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said their father, and they
cocked their little heads on one side, and
pricked up their ears to hear the tiniest
scratch he could make.</p>

<p>"Scamper!" and they ran across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
floor and slipped into a hole as quick as
a wink.</p>

<p>They were taught to steal eggs, and to
avoid traps, and when they had a lesson
in apples you should have seen them work!
Every one of them, except Duncie, of
course, could gnaw into an apple and pick
out the seeds before Mother Rat could
count ten.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Barnes' storeroom there were
long rows of tumblers filled with jelly.
The tumblers were all sealed with paraffine,
but the rats soon learned how to gnaw
it off, and then what a feast they had!</p>

<p>They were growing so bold that Father
Rat began to be anxious about them.
"You children ought to be a little more
careful," he said. "You'll get into trouble
some day."</p>

<p>"We never have been caught," said
Squeaker.</p>

<p>"No," said Frisky, "and we never will
be. We know too much for that."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>One morning Father and Mother Rat
went to visit an old uncle who lived down
beside the pond, and they left the ten
young rats all alone.</p>

<p>The minute they were gone Long Tail
whispered, "Come on, Ratsies; let's go
down to the cellar for some jelly."</p>

<p>"Father told us not to," answered
Whiskers.</p>

<p>"'Fraid cat, 'fraid cat!" cried Frisky.
"Who's going to be a 'fraid cat?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Spottie. "Not I," said
Bobby; and in two seconds they were
every one scampering down to the storeroom.</p>

<p>They nibbled away at the jelly for a
little while, but Bobby soon found a stone
jar with a cover on it.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Ratsies," he called.</p>

<p>Whiskers sniffed at the cover three
times. "There are grape preserves in that
jar," he said at last.</p>

<p>"We must have some," cried Bobby.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"Yes, yes," squeaked Tiny; "there's
nothing I like half so well as grape
preserves."</p>

<p>"I am the biggest," said Jumbo, "so
I ought to get off the cover." He pulled
and pushed, and worked away until the
cover came off.</p>

<p>"Goody, goody, goody!" squealed all
the rats together, and they plunged in
their paws and gobbled up the grapes so
fast that their faces were soon purple and
sticky with the sweet preserve.</p>

<p>They were not very quiet about it,
either. They forgot there was some one
else in the house.</p>

<p>Suddenly Listen pricked up his ears.
"Ratsies," he whispered, "I hear a noise."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, he did hear a noise;
for down the cellar stairs came Nig, the
big black cat.</p>

<p>Then how those rats did scamper!
They ran this way and that, across the
floor, and up the wall, and under boxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and barrels. It seemed to Nig as if the
cellar were full of rats. She caught one
for her dinner. It was Duncie, of course;
and then there were only nine rats in the
family.</p>

<p>They were all more careful for a little
while; but young rats are very venturesome,
and it wasn't many days before
they wanted to go down into the pantry.</p>

<p>Listen said he hadn't heard a sound all
the morning, and so they decided to creep
down very quietly.</p>

<p>The truth was that Mr. and Mrs.
Barnes had gone away for a month, and
the house was empty; but of course the
rats didn't know anything about that.</p>

<p>There wasn't a single crumb on the
pantry shelves, so they crept into the
kitchen. Whiskers gave a long sniff, and
before the others knew what he was doing,
he was up on a shelf behind the stove.</p>

<p>"Come on, brothers and sisters," he
squealed. "Here is something that smells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
good. It seems to be on the end of little
sticks, but we can gnaw it off."</p>

<p>"Of course we can," cried Jumbo.
"Let's all get to work." He tossed the
matches around on the shelf, and the
nine rats went to work with a will.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a hot little flame.
Spot's eye-teeth were very sharp, and he
had lighted the phosphorus on the end of
his match. The flame lighted another
match, and a little fire was soon burning
merrily.</p>

<p>It happened that Mr. Barnes had left
a pile of old papers on the shelf beside
the matches. They quickly took fire, and
the frightened rat children fled in terror
to the attic.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother! Oh, Father!" they
screamed, "something dreadful has happened
in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>"There was a bright light, and a queer
smell that choked us," panted Whiskers.</p>

<p>Father Rat understood at once that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
there was a fire. He scolded the nine
young rats for being in the kitchen at all.
"We are in great danger," he said. "We
must give up this home, and try to save
our lives. I can smell the smoke now.
Hurry, children, hurry!"</p>

<p>Luckily rats don't have to pack up their
clothes or throw their furniture out of
the window. They escaped with their
lives; but the old farmhouse was burned
to the ground, all because Mr. Barnes
had left the matches on the shelf beside
the papers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Where did Father Rat build his nest?</i></p>

<p><i>Why do rats prefer such places for their
home?</i></p>

<p><i>What food did the young rats find in the
storeroom?</i></p>

<p><i>What did they find in the kitchen?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Rats and mice are attracted to places
where they can obtain food, such as barns
where grain is kept, rooms where food is
stored or where refuse is thrown. Buildings,
so far as possible, should be made
"rat-proof." To insure safety, matches
should be kept in tin cans, metal boxes, or
jars.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW NOT TO HAVE FIRES</h2></div>


<p class="center"><strong>I</strong></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> a boy plays with matches,
or a man carelessly throws away
a lighted cigar, he does not stop
to think that the fire he causes goes to
make up a part of the tremendous fire loss
in our country.</p>

<p>This loss amounts to about $250,000,000
a year. Sometimes, if there is a big fire in
one of our large cities, the sum is much
greater; sometimes it is a little less.</p>

<p>This average loss of $250,000,000 means
that property is burned up at the rate of
$500 a minute for every one of the sixty minutes
in every one of the twenty-four hours
in all the three hundred and sixty-five days
in the year. If this seems impossible to you,
just multiply $500 by 60 &times;  24 &times;  365.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>It is said that two-thirds of all the fires
in the country are caused by carelessness,
ignorance, or lack of proper precaution,
and that they might have been prevented.
The question before every one in the United
States&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;is
how not to have so many fires,&mdash;because
the fires destroy forests which require at
least fifty years to grow, timber which
comes from these slow-growing forests,
houses which have been built at great cost
of time, labor, and money, and treasures
and heirlooms which can never be replaced.</p>

<p>Besides this loss of property there is
also a great loss of life, which is too appalling
to consider in this little book.</p>

<p>The very best way not to have fires is
not to set them. If you stop to think of
it, there are not so very many different
things that will start fires. Matches,
kerosene, gas, gasoline, hot sparks, burning
tobacco, fires in stoves, furnaces, and
fire-places, hot ashes, lightning, and fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
which start themselves by "spontaneous
combustion," are the common causes of
our losses; but there are hundreds, almost
thousands, of different ways in which
fires are set with these few materials.</p>

<p><i>Matches</i> are one of the most useful
things in the house, and also one of the
most dangerous. They should be kept in
a covered dish, out of the reach of children;
and they should never be left lying around
loose. The parlor match is especially
dangerous as the head often flies off into
curtains or clothing. After a match is
once lighted it should never be thrown
down carelessly. Put the stick that is
left in the stove or in a match receiver.
Never throw it in a basket of waste paper
or on the floor. Even if it is thrown on
the ground it might set fire to dry grass or
leaves.</p>

<p>You start a fire when you light a match.
See that you put it out.</p>

<p><i>Kerosene</i>, used in lamps, lanterns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
oil-stoves, has caused untold loss and suffering.
Never fill a lamp, lantern, or oil-stove
when it is lighted. Never use kerosene
to start the fire in the kitchen range.
Never leave a lamp burning when you go
out of the room, as it may explode or fill
the house with smoke. Keep your lamps
clean and see that the wick fits the burner.
A clean, well-kept lamp will not explode.</p>

<p>Never set a lamp on the table so that it
can be easily tipped over, or on a sewing-machine
where it can be pushed off with
the work. Turn the wick down half-way
before blowing out the lamp, and when
the lamp is not lighted keep the wick below
the burner so that the oil will not be
drawn up and spread over the outside of
the lamp. Never carry a lighted lamp
into a closet where clothing is hanging.
An electric flash-light is the only thing
which can be used for this purpose with
safety.</p>

<p><i>Gasoline</i> is sometimes used in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
for cleaning clothing, curtains, gloves, etc.
There is no material in the world so dangerous
to handle, except possibly dynamite.
Gasoline gives off a large volume of vapor
which is both inflammable and explosive.
For this reason it should never be used in a
room where there is a candle, a lamp, a
lighted cigar, or where there is a fire in the
stove. The only safe place to use gasoline
is out of doors, and even then the greatest
caution should be taken. Keep the doors
and windows closed so that none of the
vapor can get into the house, and be very
careful not to let any one come near you
with a lighted cigar or pipe. Throw the
waste gasoline on the ground; never pour
it in the sink or down a waste pipe.</p>

<p>Gasoline, naphtha, and benzine are similar
substances, and are equally explosive
and dangerous. All cans containing either
one should be plainly marked to avoid mistakes,
and should not be kept in or near
the building. Many cleaning and polishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
compounds contain naphtha, and
should therefore be handled with extreme
caution.</p>

<p>Never leave any of these cans uncovered.
Beware of leaks in the cans, and never
forget that you are handling a dangerous
material.</p>

<p><i>Hot ashes</i> cause many fires. They should
never be thrown into a wooden box or
barrel, or piled up against the house, barn,
or fence. Put them in a metal barrel with
a metal cover. Do not put waste paper,
rags, or rubbish in the ash barrel. Ashes
will sometimes take fire of themselves, by
spontaneous combustion, if they are wet.
This is why it is unsafe to leave an ash
pile near a fence or building.</p>

<p><i>Waste</i> papers, rubbish, greasy cloths,
oily waste and rags should be destroyed.
They should never be allowed to collect
in cellars, attics, or closets, under the stairs
or in the yard. Keep the whole house
clean. Dust, dirt, and rubbish are fire-breeders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
This is especially true in factories,
shops, fruit and grocery stores, schoolhouses,
churches, and all public buildings.
It is cheaper to throw away barrels, boxes,
papers, sawdust, painter's cloths, old rags&mdash;waste
of any kind&mdash;than to burn it up
by setting the house on fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE KITCHEN FIRE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Tommy taylor</span> was a lazy boy,&mdash;there
wasn't a doubt of it. He
didn't like to get up in the morning,
and he didn't like to go to school. When
his mother asked him to bring in some
wood, he always said, "Can't you wait a
minute?" and if she wanted him to do an
errand he would answer, "Oh dear! Must
I do it now?"</p>

<p>He liked to play ball, of course; and he
would spend the whole afternoon building
a snow fort or carrying pails of water to
make a hill icy for coasting; but he didn't
call that work. It was play, and Tommy
wasn't one bit lazy about playing.</p>

<p>One noon when Tommy and his sister
were eating dinner their mother said,
"I'm going shopping this afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
I may not get home until half-past five.
I want both of you children to come
straight home from school, and at five
o'clock you can build the kitchen fire and
put the tea-kettle on the stove. If you
have a good fire it will not take me long
to get supper ready.</p>

<p>"Alice may take the key because she is
older and more careful. She may build
the fire, too; but you, Tommy, must get
the wood, and help her all you can."</p>

<p>Alice was only twelve years old, two
years older than Tommy, but she felt
very much grown up as she started off
for school with the key of the back door
in her pocket.</p>

<p>"Wait for me to-night at the schoolyard
gate," she told her brother, as they
separated at the door to go to their class-rooms.</p>

<p>"All right," said Tommy, "I will wait
for you." But he forgot his promise when
Jack Marsh whispered to him that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
boys were going to build a snow fort in
his yard; and he went whooping off with
them the minute school was over, eager
for the fun of a snow fight.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock when he remembered
that his mother had told him
to go straight home from school, but he
stopped for just one more snowball battle,
and when he finally reached home he found
Alice at the door watching for him.</p>

<p>"Here, Tommy," she said, "take this
basket and get me some chips in the wood-shed.
There are enough big sticks for the
fire; but you forgot to bring in the kindling
this noon."</p>

<p>"I didn't have time," said Tommy,
hurrying off with the basket; "but I'll
get you some good chips in a minute."</p>

<p>When he began to pick up the chips, he
found that they were all wet with snow,
for the last time it stormed he had left
the door open and the snow had blown in
on the woodpile. There were some dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
chips in a farther corner, but it was too
much work to climb over the wood to
get them, and besides, Alice was in a hurry;
so he picked up the wet chips, shook off
the snow, and carried the basketful into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can build the fire with
this kind of kindling," said Alice, as she
began laying it in the stove. "It is so
wet that it will not burn."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it will, if you use paper
enough," her brother told her, and when
Alice struck a match and lighted the fire
it went roaring up the chimney.</p>

<p>"I knew those chips would burn," said
Tommy. "Now put in some big sticks
of wood."</p>

<p>Just then the fire stopped roaring, and
when Alice lifted the cover to find out
what was the matter, she could see nothing
but a thin curl of smoke.</p>

<p>"Put in some more paper," her brother
advised, "you didn't have enough before."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>So Alice put in more paper and chips,
and lighted the fire again. It burned up
brightly for a minute and then settled
down into a discouraging smoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" she sighed, as she took off
the cover and looked into the stove once
more, "there is nothing but a tiny blaze
down in one corner. Run and get some
dry chips, Tommy. I can't do anything
with these wet ones."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what to do," said her
brother, who was putting on his slippers
and didn't want to go out to the shed
again; "pour in some kerosene. That
will make the fire burn. I saw Mother do
it once when she was in a hurry."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Alice. "I didn't
think of that," and she went to the closet
to get the kerosene can. It was so light
when she lifted it that she thought it
must be empty; but when she shook it
she found there was a very little oil in the
bottom of the can.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"Here, I'll pour it on for you," said
Tommy, and as Alice raised the cover of
the stove, he tipped up the can and poured
a tiny stream of oil over the wet wood.</p>

<p>The little blaze in the corner was still
flickering feebly. It saw the oil coming
and rushed up to meet it. "Whee-ee-ee!"
it cried, "there's something that will
burn. That's just what I like;" and it
ran merrily across the wood and flashed
up to the can in Tommy's hand.</p>

<p>Tommy was so frightened that he let
the can fall on the floor, but not before
the oil in it had caught fire. Fortunately
there were only a few drops left, so the can
did not explode; but the wood and paper
in the stove were now burning furiously.
There was a terrible roaring in the chimney,
and clouds of black smoke poured out into
the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tommy," screamed Alice, "what
shall we do? We have set the house on
fire!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>"No, we haven't," replied her brother;
"it is dying down a little now. Open the
windows and let out some of this smoke."</p>

<p>Alice opened the windows, and when
the roaring had ceased, and the chips
had burned to ashes, the two children sat
down and looked at each other. Neither
one could speak a word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor came in just then, and when
Alice saw her she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" questioned her
mother, sitting down and taking the child
in her arms; but Alice could only sob
that they almost set the house on fire.</p>

<p>"It was all my fault," spoke up Tommy.
"I got some wet chips to build the fire,
because I was too lazy to climb over the
woodpile and get some dry ones. Then
when they wouldn't burn I told Alice to
pour on kerosene."</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor put her arm around Tommy
and drew him to her side. "My son," she
said, "it was your fault that the chips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
were wet; but it was ten times my fault
that you poured kerosene on the fire. If
it has taught you a lesson, it has taught
me one, too. I shall never use kerosene
again to light a fire. It is a very dangerous
thing to do.</p>

<p>"We often read in the paper of serious
fires that have been caused in just such a
way, sometimes even with a loss of life.
Promise me now that you will never pour
another drop of kerosene into the stove
as long as you live, and I will give you my
promise, too. Now let's all build the fire,
together."</p>

<p>So Tommy ran cheerfully out to the
shed and brought in a big basketful of
dry chips, Alice crumpled up the paper,
her mother lighted the match, and in a
few minutes the kitchen fire was blazing
merrily.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did Tommy bring in the wet chips?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did not the fire burn well at first?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><i>What did Tommy suggest using? Why?
What happened?</i></p>

<p><i>What might have happened if the kerosene
can had been full?</i></p>

<p><i>What is the proper use of kerosene?</i></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rules for the Use of Kerosene</span></h3>

<p>Always keep kerosene in a metal can.</p>

<p>Always keep the can tightly closed,
and keep it as far from the stove as
possible.</p>

<p>Never use kerosene to light a fire.</p>

<p>Never, never use it to start up a slow
fire.</p>

<p>You will probably set yourself or the
house on fire if you do.</p>

<p>Fill all the lamps and oil-stoves by daylight.
If you must fill them after dark,
never do so while they are still lighted.
The flame in the lamp might set fire to the
kerosene vapor in the air, and this in turn
ignite the oil. If the fire runs up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
stream of oil into the can, the can will
explode.</p>

<p>Remember that the three most dangerous
things in the world for setting fires are
<i>kerosene</i>, <i>gasoline</i>, and <i>matches</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW NOT TO HAVE FIRES</h2></div>

<p class="center"><strong>II</strong></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an old saying that "A
fool can build a fire, but it takes
a wise man to keep it burning."
This is not true of the fire in the kitchen
stove, which should always be built by a
wise and thoughtful person. The kitchen
fire has caused the loss of many lives and
an enormous amount of property.</p>

<p>In laying the fire use paper and dry
kindlings. Never pour on kerosene. Do
not fill the stove too full of paper, as the
smoke may accumulate and blow open
the door, thus scattering the burning
embers around the room.</p>

<p>After the fire is burning well, close the
drafts. Do not allow the stove to get
red-hot, as it will not only warp the covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and crack the stove, but it may set fire
to the woodwork on the walls or floor.</p>

<p>A roaring fire will sometimes set fire to
the soot in the chimney, or carry burning
sparks to the roof of the house.</p>

<p>The stove should be set at least eighteen
inches away from the woodwork, and the
floor beneath it should be covered with
brick, tiles, or a sheet of metal.</p>

<p>Never leave the house, or go to bed,
when the drafts of the stove or furnace
are open. Overheated furnaces have
caused many serious fires in the night.
Even a low fire will sometimes burn up
unexpectedly, especially if the wind blows
hard enough to create a strong draft.
Do not allow waste or rubbish to collect
near the furnace, and do not keep the
wood-box near the stove.</p>

<p><i>Chimneys</i> should be carefully inspected,
and repaired when it is necessary, as they
frequently crack with the settling of the
house. They should be cleaned occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to prevent the accumulation of soot,
which will burn with a fierce heat, setting
the attic or roof on fire.</p>

<p>If there are open chimney-holes in any
of the rooms in the house do not stuff
them, or cover them, with paper, especially
if they are in the same flues which
are used for stoves, furnaces, or fire-places.
Chimney-holes should always be covered
with a tightly-fitted cap or "thimble"
made of metal. These caps can be bought
of a tin-smith for a small sum.</p>

<p>If the soot in the chimney is on fire,
shake on salt or sulphur to extinguish the
flames.</p>

<p><i>Fire-places</i> add a great deal to the attractiveness
of a house, but they are especially
dangerous if there are children in the
family. The sparks often fly out into
the room, setting fire to rugs or clothing;
babies crawl too near the open
blaze; or little girls stand too near the
hearth and their thin dresses or aprons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
are drawn into the fire by the strong
upward draft.</p>

<p>Every fire-place should have a hearth of
bricks or tiles at least two feet wide, and
the fire should be protected by a wire
screen. If there are young children in
the household, there should also be a fender
to keep them at a safe distance from the
flames. Some kinds of light wood, especially
chestnut and hemlock, will snap
and produce many sparks. These sparks
fly out in all directions unless the fire is
covered with a wire screen. Do not build
a roaring fire in the fire-place, as it may
carry sparks to the roof.</p>

<p>All fire-places, open grates, and gas-logs
should be surrounded by bricks or tiles,
so that the woodwork will not catch fire.
In many cities there are laws regulating
the construction of chimneys and fire-places.</p>

<p><i>Pipes</i>, <i>cigars</i>, and <i>cigarettes</i> have caused
nearly $10,000,000 worth of damage by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
fire. Lighted matches thrown away by
careless smokers have added $15,000,000
more to this enormous waste. Every one
of these fires was absolutely unnecessary.
Cigar and cigarette stubs should not be
thrown into waste baskets, rubbish heaps,
dry grass or leaves. They should never be
dropped from the window, as they might
set fire to an awning, and they should not
be allowed to fall through a grating where
there may be a collection of waste paper
and rubbish. If you see a lighted cigar
or cigarette stub in the street, crush it
under your heel until the fire is all out. If
there is one in your house, throw it in the
stove. In this way you may save property
and human life.</p>

<p><i>Christmas</i> and <i>Fourth of July</i> are the
two happiest days in the whole year for
children, yet oftentimes they are followed
by sorrow and suffering.</p>

<p>Christmas trees, when they are lighted
by candles, are easily set on fire, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
are often decorated with festoons of paper,
and cotton "frost," which comes in contact
with the tiny flames. Many of the
ornaments on the tree are made of celluloid.
These ornaments catch fire easily
and flare up with a quick hot flame, thus
setting fire to the branches, which are full
of pitch and resin and burn freely.</p>

<p>No one but a grown person should light
the candles. Children should be kept at
a safe distance from the tree, doors and
windows should be closed to exclude the
draft, a constant watch should be kept
while the candles are burning, and they
should all be extinguished before a single
present is taken from the tree. This is
especially important if the presents are
distributed by Santa Claus, as his long
beard, and the cotton fur on his clothing,
are easily ignited from the candles.</p>

<p>The celebration of the Fourth of July
is one of the most serious problems in the
country. Fireworks are dangerous play-things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and should be used with the greatest
caution. Every year many persons are
killed or injured, and valuable property
is destroyed by the careless use of fireworks.</p>

<p>There are some kinds of fireworks
which should never be used under any
circumstances. Among these are cannon
crackers, fire balloons, toy pistols, toy
cannon, bombs, and revolvers firing blank
cartridges.</p>

<p>On the day before the Fourth, all yards
should be cleared of rubbish, as falling
sparks might set it on fire. During the
day of the celebration cellar windows
should be closed, and stables and barns
should be opened only when necessary.</p>

<p>In many cities the sale of dangerous
fireworks is prohibited by law; but a
common fire-cracker, a Roman candle, or
a sky-rocket may cause serious damage if
it is not handled properly.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE SUNSHINE BAND</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunshine Band was made up of
twelve little girls, one for each of
the twelve letters in their name.
They wore badges of yellow ribbon just
the color of sunshine, with the letters
S. B. painted on them in white, and every
time they had a meeting they sang their
own special song;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">"Scatter sunshine all along your way,</div>
<div class="verse">Cheer and bless and brighten every passing day."</div>
</div></blockquote>

<p>They had a secret, too, and a motto.
Their motto was "Scatter Sunshine," and
their secret&mdash;but I'm not going to tell
you their secret. They didn't even tell
me. I just guessed it.</p>

<p>They met every Saturday afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
first at one house and then another. Each
little girl was always expected to tell a
sunshine story, and if any one had disobeyed
the rules of the club she had to pay
a fine. Perhaps you will think that the
rules were not so very hard to remember,
but every once in a while a penny went
clinking down to the bottom of their
bank.</p>

<p>First of all they were expected to bring
sunshine into their own homes. They
must say "Good-morning" cheerfully, no
matter if the day were cloudy and dismal.
They must come to the table with clean
hands and faces and a pleasant smile;
and they must not frown or look cross
if their mother asked them to wipe the
dishes when they wanted to play out of
doors.</p>

<p>Then all day long they must keep their
eyes and ears open to find some helpful
thing to do, no matter how small it might
be; and if, at night, they had not done one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
tiny useful thing they must make a black
cross against the day.</p>

<p>You would hardly believe how much
sunshine they could make with very little
trying, and how many pleasant tales they
had to tell at their meetings.</p>

<p>Two of the girls gathered flowers every
week for one of the hospitals; one did
errands for a neighbor who was lame;
three, who had sweet voices, gave little
concerts at the home for aged women,
and another read aloud to a blind girl
every Monday afternoon after school.</p>

<p>Sometimes they packed boxes of old
books and toys to send to a mission school
in the South, and once they shook every
penny out of their bank to buy fruit for
a little sick girl.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, who was the teacher of
their class in Sunday-school, was also the
leader of the band; and whenever they
had an especially good sunshine story they
carried it to her. She kept their badge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
honor, too, unless some one was wearing
it as a reward for good service.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">In the largest cities the firemen find their hardest work</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon, as soon as
their meeting was over, they hurried off
to her house. "Oh! Miss Hastings,"
they cried, when she opened the door,
"Hilda Browning told the best story of
all to-day, and we want her to have the
badge right away."</p>

<p>"What is it, Hilda?" questioned Miss
Hastings, after she had led the way to her
sunny living-room.</p>

<p>"Tell her," urged all the other girls
when Hilda hung back, her face rosy with
blushes.</p>

<p>"It was nothing," said Hilda shyly,
"I just happened to be there at the right
time. That was all."</p>

<p>"Happened to be where?" asked the
teacher, "and what do you mean by the
right time?"</p>

<p>"At Mrs. Hazen's," said three or four
of the girls at once. "The curtain caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
fire from the gas jet and Hilda tore it
down and threw it out of the window."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" begged their teacher,
putting her hands over her ears; "I can't
hear what you say when you all talk
together. Now, Hilda, begin at the
beginning."</p>

<p>So, with many promptings from the
girls, who had heard the story from Mrs.
Hazen herself, Hilda told how she had
saved the house from fire.</p>

<p>"You know Mrs. Hazen has been sick
with rheumatism for over a year," she
said. "Her daughter, who has always
taken care of her, has gone away for a two
weeks' vacation, so I have been going
there every afternoon after school to stay
for an hour while the nurse takes a walk.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I said I would stay two
hours because it was Friday and I didn't
have any lessons to learn; and I took over
my 'Youth's Companion' to read a story.</p>

<p>"It was such a cloudy afternoon that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
grew dark while I was reading and Mrs.
Hazen told me to light the gas. When I
finished the story she asked me to open the
bed-room window to let in some fresh air,
and then bring her a glass of water.</p>

<p>"As I opened the kitchen door to get
the water, a gust of wind blew the muslin
window-curtain into the gas flame. It
blazed up in an instant and Mrs. Hazen
screamed for help."</p>

<p>"And when Hilda ran into the room and
saw the curtain on fire she pulled it down
with her bare hands and threw it out of
the window," put in Ethel Strong. "The
fingers on her right hand are all blistered,
but she saved the house from catching
fire."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she saved Mrs. Hazen's life,
too," added Dorothy Hovey. "You know
Mrs. Hazen has the rheumatism so badly
that she cannot take a single step, and if
she had been alone no one knows what
might have happened."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>"Now, Miss Hastings, don't you think
Hilda deserves the badge of honor?"
spoke up Alice Hunter.</p>

<p>"Yes, she certainly does," replied Miss
Hastings, and, as she spoke, she took from
its box a gold pin with the letters S. S. in
blue enamel, and fastened it at Hilda's
throat.</p>

<p>"Not all of us may ever have an opportunity
to save a house from fire, or a life
from danger," she added; "but if Hilda
had not been doing a little kindness she
would not have been ready in time of
need to do a greater one."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did the girls call themselves the Sunshine
Band?</i></p>

<p><i>What were some of their rules?</i></p>

<p><i>What did the letters S. S. mean on their
badge of honor?</i></p>

<p><i>What kind things did they do?</i></p>

<p><i>How did the muslin curtain catch fire?</i></p>

<p><i>How could this have been prevented?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span><i>Why is it dangerous to have a gas jet near
a window?</i></p>

<p><i>How should all gas flames be protected?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A gas jet should always be protected by
a glass globe or a wire frame, and the
bracket should be rigid so that it cannot be
folded back against the wood-work, and
cannot swing against curtains or draperies.
If the curtain catches fire, pull it down
quickly and smother the flames with a
heavy rug. A woman should never attempt
to stamp out the flames, as her
skirts will easily catch fire.</p>

<p>If there is an odor of gas anywhere in
the house, especially in a dark closet, do
not search for the leak with a match or a
lighted candle. If you should happen to
find the leak you might cause an explosion
or set the house on fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VACATION AT GRANDPA'S</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Did</span> I ever tell you about the time
we boys set Grandpa Snow's barn
on fire? It happened long ago,
but I shall never forget it, if I live to be a
hundred years old.</p>

<p>Kenneth and I always thought no better
luck would ever come to us than to be
told that we might spend the last week of
July and the whole month of August with
Grandpa and Grandma Snow.</p>

<p>Grandpa Snow owned a large farm up
among the Green Mountains, and as our
home was in the city, you can imagine
how much it meant to us to hear that we
were to spend five long weeks in the
country.</p>

<p>I was eleven years old and Kenneth was
eight, and as we had to change cars but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
once, Father said we might go all the way
alone.</p>

<p>We left the station at eight o'clock in
the morning, in the care of a good-natured,
obliging conductor who promised to see
that we changed cars safely at White River
Junction, and the long ride in the train
seemed just a part of the vacation fun.</p>

<p>I truly think that we did just as Mother
would have liked us to do all that day.
She looked so sweet and earnest when she
bade us good-bye and said, "Now, boys,
be kind and polite to everyone who speaks
to you," that we couldn't help remembering
her words.</p>

<p>There was a tired-looking woman on
the train. She had a little boy who was
tired, too, and he kept crying and fussing,
until at last Kenneth said he was going
to take him over in our seat and amuse
him.</p>

<p>The boy was a jolly little fellow, about
the age of our dear little baby sister at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
home, and we three had such a good time
together that we could hardly believe our
ears when the brakeman shouted out,
"Walden! Walden!"</p>

<p>We gathered our bags and boxes together
in a hurry, and bade good-bye to
our new-found friends. In a minute we
were out on the station platform, and the
train was whizzing away without us; but
we didn't have time to wonder if any one
were coming to meet us, for down the road
came Grandpa Snow, rattling along in a
big hay-rack and waving his old straw hat
at us.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys!" he said, as he pulled up
his horses beside the platform; "we were
pretty busy in the hay-field to-day, so I
thought I could come right along, and give
you a ride in my new hay-wagon. There's
no fancy top on it, but there is plenty of
room for both of you young chaps and all
your baggage. You'll like it better than
an automobile ride, I'll wager. So this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
is Leslie and Kenneth, is it? You surely
have grown! Why, I can hardly tell one
from the other, but I'll trust Grandma
to know. She always seems to understand
boys pretty well."</p>

<p>After a hug, and a hand-shake, and a
hearty laugh, we jogged along up the road.
Even if we were only boys I don't believe
we shall ever forget that ride. It was late
in the afternoon, and the air was so cool
and sweet that it hardly seemed as if it
could be the same hot, dusty day we
began in the city. We could smell the
cedar and fir-balsam all along the way, and
every little while there was a bird-note
like a sweet-toned bell.</p>

<p>It wasn't very long before we spied
Grandpa's house, and dear old Grandma
in the door waving her apron to us.</p>

<p>"Well, Mother," called out Grandpa,
as we drove into the yard, "here are two
new hired men for you. How do you think
you will like them?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>By the way Grandma hugged us and
kissed us, I guess she thought we would
suit her pretty well. I remember something
that suited us, too, and that was the
good things we had to eat that night.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is any one else in the
whole world who can cook like one's own
grandmother? Perhaps there is,&mdash;but
I know one thing, Grandma Snow was the
best cook I ever saw. You should have
seen that supper! There were hot biscuits,
and fried chicken, and honey, and
gingerbread, and cookies, and strawberry
tarts, and cottage cheese, and so many
good things that we couldn't eat half of
them.</p>

<p>Every time we stopped eating Grandma
would say, "Something must be the matter
with these boys. They haven't any
appetite." And Grandpa would look at
us over his spectacles and answer, "They
do look pale and thin. Give them another
tart." Then he'd give one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
great laughs and shake all over like a big
bowl of jelly.</p>

<p>We had just time after supper to help
Grandpa and the hired man get in one
load of hay. Then it was dark, and we
were so tired and sleepy that we were glad
to climb into bed,&mdash;just the highest,
whitest, softest bed you ever saw.</p>

<p>We made Grandma promise to call us
very early, and at five o'clock the next
morning we were ready for breakfast and
the day's work in the hay-field.</p>

<p>What fun it was to rake after the wagon,
and to ride home on those great, sweet-smelling
loads of hay!</p>

<p>Of course we had plenty of time to play,
but we liked to work, too; and the work
on a farm seems like play to boys who
have always lived in the city.</p>

<p>We used to go down to the garden
every morning to pick the vegetables for
dinner, and we always helped Grandma
shell the peas and string the beans. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
took a good big panful, too, for we were
pretty hungry up there on the farm.</p>

<p>Every morning we drove the cows to
the pasture, and every afternoon we drove
them home. We hunted for hens' eggs in
the big barn, and went blueberrying and
blackberrying. Kenneth made a collection
of wild flowers, and Grandma showed
him how to press them so that he could
take them home.</p>

<p>What good times we did have! Even on
rainy days there was always something
to do, and we often had the most fun of
all when it was raining the hardest. All
the boys in the neighborhood got into the
habit of coming to play with us in one of
Grandpa's barns; and we used to have
circuses and tight-rope walking and all
sorts of games.</p>

<p>But one day, when we had been having
a very jolly time together, one of the boys
suggested that we should try a new game.
"I'm tired of walking on beams and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
jumping off hay-mows," he said. "Let's
do something different."</p>

<p>He took a whole bunch of matches out
of his pocket and held them up. "Let's
try scratching matches, and see who can
scratch the most and blow them out again
in one minute," he suggested.</p>

<p>I, for one, knew very well that matches
were not made to play with, and I said so.
Kenneth and Willie Smith agreed with me.
So did Joe Wiggin and Peter Fisher, but
four or five of the boys thought it would
be great fun, and in spite of all we could
say the match-race began.</p>

<p>Four boys sat down in a circle on the
barn floor, lighting and blowing out the
matches just as fast as they could, while
Harry Plummer counted sixty.</p>

<p>In their hurry, they threw the matches
down carelessly, and before any of us
noticed it, a lighted match had been thrown
into the hay.</p>

<p>It blazed up in an instant, and before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
could run to the field for help the whole
barn was a roaring furnace. Joe Wiggin
and Peter Fisher led out the two horses,
and fortunately, the cows were in the
pasture, for in less than half an hour the
barn was burned to the ground. All the
hay that we had worked so hard to get in
was lost, besides some of Grandpa's tools
and his new hay-rack.</p>

<p>Grandpa and the hired man got there
in time to save the harnesses and a few
little things, and then all we could do was
just to stand there and watch the barn
burn. The nearest fire-engine was in the
village four miles away, and all the water
we had was in one well.</p>

<p>Luckily Grandpa's buildings were not
joined together, and as there was no wind,
only that one barn was burned. But
that was one too many.</p>

<p>I tell you, I shall never forget that fire,
and to this day I can't see a boy with
matches in his pocket without wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
tell him this story and urge him to remember
all his life that matches are made for
use and not for playthings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Tell of some of the good times you have
had on a farm.</i></p>

<p><i>What did the boys do on rainy days?</i></p>

<p><i>What game did one of them propose?</i></p>

<p><i>What happened while they were playing
this game?</i></p>

<p><i>What are matches made for?</i></p>

<p><i>How should they be used?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are several kinds of matches,&mdash;brimstone
matches, parlor matches, bird's-eye
matches, and safety matches. Safety
matches can be lighted only on their own
box, and are, therefore, the safest match
to use. Parlor matches, so called, are
dangerous, as they break easily and the
blazing head flies off, lodging in clothing,
draperies, or furniture. The sale of
parlor matches is forbidden by law in
New York City on account of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
number of fires which have resulted from
their use.</p>

<p>Common matches should be kept in a
tin box; they should be used carefully,
and never thrown away while they are
burning, or even while the stick is still
red-hot. It is a bad habit to have matches
scattered around the house, or lying loose
in bureau drawers, in desks, on tables, or
in the pockets of clothing. There are
many ways in which fires have been caused
by loose matches. Lucifer or brimstone
matches have been known to burst into
flame from the heat caused by the sun's
rays shining through a window pane.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE FIRE DRILL</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a warm, sunny afternoon in
October,&mdash;one of the days of Indian
summer that come to tempt us out of
doors after vacation is over, and work has
begun in earnest.</p>

<p>The pupils of the sixth grade in the
Ashland School looked longingly out of the
windows as they put away their spellers and
took the reading-books from their desks.
Their teacher saw the look, and understood
what it meant. When the hands
of the clock pointed to half-past two, and
the bell rang for a five-minutes' recess, she
said, "You may put on your hats and
coats, and we will spend a half-hour in our
garden. I noticed this noon that it needed
some attention."</p>

<p>The children looked at each other and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
nodded eagerly. It was just the day for
a lesson in gardening, of that they felt sure,
especially if it meant a whole half-hour out
of doors.</p>

<p>The school garden was their greatest
pleasure. They had spent many a happy
hour working together over the flower beds,
since that morning in April when Miss
Brigham had ended their lesson in nature-study
by asking, "How many would like
to help me make a garden in the schoolyard?"</p>

<p>Every hand flew up instantly, every
face brightened with delight. There was
not a boy or girl in the room who was not
eager to begin at once; and the moment
the frost was well out of the ground they
went to work.</p>

<p>The boys spaded up the soil, and the
girls helped rake it over and mark it out
in beds. There was a narrow strip the
whole length of the fence for a hedge of
sunflowers, and in front of it were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
square plots, one for each of the three
classes in the grade.</p>

<p>The children sent everywhere for seed
catalogues, and studied them eagerly.
Each class bought its own seeds and
planted them, and once every week they
spent a half-hour hoeing, weeding, and
watering the garden.</p>

<p>In one plot morning-glories climbed
over a wire trellis and turned their bright
faces to the morning sun, in another there
was a gay riot of nasturtiums. During
the summer the girls picked fragrant
bouquets of sweet peas, and all through
the fall they gathered sunny yellow marigolds
for the teacher's desk.</p>

<p>But now Jack Frost had taken his turn
at gardening. The nasturtiums and morning-glories
hung in ragged festoons from
their trellises, and the heavy heads of the
sunflowers drooped from the top of the
dry stalks. There was nothing left in
the garden but a few hardy weeds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
had grown in spite of the watchful gardeners.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to do," said one
of the girls, as she followed Miss Brigham
across the schoolyard. "We may as well
let the weeds grow now if they want to."</p>

<p>"We must clear everything away and
get the garden ready for next spring,"
replied the teacher. "You can see for
yourselves what ought to be done. I will
stand here and watch you work."</p>

<p>After all there was plenty to do. One
of the boys took out his knife and cut off
the sunflower stalks, while the girls picked
off the few seeds that the yellow-birds
had left, and tied them up in a paper to
save them for another year.</p>

<p>They tore down the vines, and pulled
up the marigolds and zinnias. They
straightened the trellises and smoothed
over the empty beds. Then they picked
up bits of paper that were blowing over
the yard, and raked up the leaves that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
fallen from the maple tree in the corner.
When the work was finished there was a
big pile of rubbish to be taken away.</p>

<p>"We might have a bonfire," suggested
one of the boys.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Brigham, "this west
wind would blow all the smoke into the
schoolhouse. Besides, there are too many
houses near by. You can put the rubbish
in the waste-barrels in the basement, and
the janitor will take care of it."</p>

<p>The other children went back to the
schoolroom, while the three largest boys
were left to clean up the yard. The waste-barrels
were full and running over; but
they hunted around in the cellar and found
an empty box in which they packed all the
rubbish. Then they went upstairs and took
up their work with the rest of the class.</p>

<p>Suddenly the big gong in the hall rang
out sharply for the fire drill,&mdash;one, two,
three! At the third stroke every book
was closed, and in the sixteen rooms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the building all the pupils rose at once to
their feet, ready to march down to the
street. The doors were thrown wide open,
and they passed out of their class-rooms
in double file to meet another file from the
opposite door, and move down the stairs
four abreast, keeping step to the double-quick
march played by one of the teachers.</p>

<p>On their way they passed the dressing-rooms,
but no one took hat or cap from
the hooks. There was not a moment to
lose. Every child must be in the street in
less than two minutes after the stroke of
the third bell. They had done it over and
over again, in exactly this same way, and
the principal was standing at the door
with his watch in his hand, counting off
the seconds. He would know if a single
child kept the line waiting.</p>

<p>"What a good day it is for a fire drill!"
they thought, as they passed through the
long halls and down the stairs; but before
the last of the older pupils were out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the building they realized that this was
no fire drill.</p>

<p>Smoke was already pouring through the
cracks in the floor and curling up around
the registers. It filled the hall with a
thick cloud that made them cough and
choke as they marched through it; but
not a boy pushed the boys in front of
him, not a girl screamed or left her place,
as the line moved steadily down the steps
and across the yard to the street.</p>

<p>Two of the teachers stood at the gates
to hurry the children off toward home,
and even before the firemen came clattering
around the corner, the big schoolhouse
was empty and the pupils were safe.</p>

<p>After the fire was out and the excitement
over, the fire chief and the principal
sent for the boys who had taken the rubbish
to the basement.</p>

<p>Yes, they had lighted some matches,
they said, because the cellar was dark,
the waste-barrels were all full, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
were trying to find an empty box. The
head of one of the matches had broken
off, but it was not burning, and they had
not thought of it again.</p>

<p>It was possible that they might have
stepped on it later and lighted it, and
that the tiny flame had set fire to the
waste paper on the floor.</p>

<p>"That was no doubt the cause of the
fire," the fire chief agreed. "Parlor
matches are often lighted in that same
way. This was, of course, an accident;
but even accidents can be avoided.</p>

<p>"In the first place there should never
be any waste paper on the basement
floor; and in the second place boys should
never carry parlor matches, or any other
kind of matches, to school. There are
more precious lives in a schoolhouse than
in any other building in the whole world."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why was the rubbish put in the basement?</i></p>

<p><i>How did it catch fire?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span><i>How could this fire have been avoided?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is it dangerous to carry matches to
school?</i></p>

<p><i>Why are parlor matches especially unsafe?</i></p>

<p><i>Have you ever seen a match break off
when it was scratched?</i></p>

<p><i>What became of the head of the match?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Schoolhouses and public buildings should
be provided with a metal-lined bin where
waste paper and refuse may be temporarily
collected, instead of allowing it to accumulate
on the basement floor or in wooden
boxes and barrels. This bin should be
located away from the stairs or corridors,
and should be so placed that water-pipes
passing over it may be provided with
sprinklers which would open automatically
in case of fire.</p>

<p>There should be fire-escapes on the
large buildings, and children should be
taught how to use them. All doors should
open outward, and should never be locked
during the school sessions. Fire drills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
should be practiced regularly, and every
child in the building should understand
the necessity for marching out promptly
and in order.</p>

<p>Chemical fire-extinguishers, or pails well
filled with water and marked "For Fire
Only," should be set in conspicuous places
on each floor near the stair-landings, and
in the basements.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIGHTING THE FIRE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Every</span> village, town, and city is
liable at any moment to have a
fire. If this fire gets well under way
it may become a conflagration, which no
single fire department can control. For
this reason promptness in reaching the
fire with suitable apparatus is of the very
first importance.</p>

<p>Great responsibility rests upon the firemen.
They must be cool-headed, but
quick in action; cautious, but daring;
ready in an instant to perform difficult
and dangerous tasks, often at the risk of
their own lives. Every great fire makes
heroes. It is this life of excitement and
daring that attracts men and makes them
eager to fight the great battles against
fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>In olden times methods of fighting fire
were very simple. The only apparatus
consisted of axes, buckets, ropes, and short
ladders. Men and boys ran to the fire and
did their best to put out the flames, but
they had no leader and could not work
to advantage.</p>

<p>The first fire-engines were drawn through
the streets by men, instead of horses, and
water was forced through the hose by
means of a hand-pump worked by these
same men.</p>

<p>Every year the system of fire protection
is being perfected, new apparatus
is invented, and better methods are introduced.</p>

<p>In the smaller towns the fire companies
consist largely of volunteer firemen, who
leave their work at the sound of the alarm
and hurry to the scene of action. But in
the larger cities the fire-department is like
a well-organized army, with its chiefs,
captains, lieutenants, and privates, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
prepared to wage a never-ending war
against the fires.</p>

<p>Most of these men live in the engine-houses,
and are ready at any moment, day
or night, to answer an alarm. The horses
stand free in their stalls, awaiting the
signal, trained like the men to instant
action.</p>

<p>With the first stroke of the great gong
the horses leave their stalls and stand
beside the pole of the engine. The harness,
suspended in mid-air, falls upon
their backs, and almost before the men
can jump up and cling to their places on
the engine, the driver picks up the reins,
the horses plunge through the open door
and gallop madly down the street.</p>

<p>The driver leans out over the pole, his
hands far apart, holding the reins in an
iron grasp and guiding the flying horses
safely along the winding way.</p>

<p>Gongs clang, whistles blow, bells ring!
The streets are cleared as if by magic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Heavy teams are drawn up beside the curbing;
electric cars stand still; men, women,
and children hurry to the sidewalks, or
stand in open doorways waiting for the
engines to go tearing along to the fire.
The fire apparatus has the right of way!</p>

<p>When the scene of the fire is reached,
the driver pulls up the horses so quickly
that they are almost thrown on their
haunches; the engine is wheeled into
place beside the hydrant, the hose is
attached and straightened out along the
street.</p>

<p>The police have already drawn a fire-line,
and are driving back the eager, curious
crowd; but the firemen have eyes or
ears for nothing but the fire. The chief
shouts his orders and they hasten to obey.
The horses are led away to a place of
safety, and ladders are brought up to be
used in case of need.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The water-tower pours a stream into the upper windows</p>

<p>Two or three men seize the nozzle of the
great hose and rush with it into the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
building to seek the heart of the fire.
Smoke pours from the doors and windows
in dense clouds, blinding and choking
them until they gasp for breath. Water
slops and spatters everywhere, steam rises
from the blazing timbers, and the intense
heat scorches and stifles them as they work.</p>

<p>At last the smoke clears away, the water
is shut off, and then, with picks and axes,
the firemen search under fallen timbers
lest some tiny blaze may still be smouldering
in a hidden corner.</p>

<p>At a quick order from the chief, the
hose is rapidly drawn back and folded in
its place, the horses are harnessed again
to the engine, and the men return to the
engine-house, to await their next call to
action.</p>

<p>In the largest cities, which have grown
rapidly skyward, piling one story on top
of another in office buildings and dwelling
houses, the firemen find their hardest
work. This is especially true in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
crowded tenement districts, where hundreds
of people live under a single roof.</p>

<p>Here men, women, and children have to
be rescued from upper windows and roofs,
by means of scaling-ladders and life-lines;
and sometimes they even have to drop
into life-nets which the firemen hold to
catch them.</p>

<p>If the building is so high that the water
from the hose cannot reach the flames, the
water-tower is brought to the scene of
action, and a stream is poured into the
building through windows many stories
above the ground.</p>

<p>In every large fire-department several
different kinds of apparatus are needed.
There is a chemical engine for use in case
the fire proves to be small and easily controlled.
There are long trucks loaded with
ladders, tools, and ropes; and there are
also the regular fire engines, sometimes
drawn by plunging horses, sometimes
driven through the streets at a high rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of speed by a powerful motor. These
motors are superior to horses because they
can reach the fire more quickly, and can
carry heavier and more powerful engines.</p>

<p>In the harbors, and in some of the larger
rivers and lakes, there are fire-boats to
be used in case of fire along the water-front,
or in vessels at the docks. These
boats always have plenty of water at
hand, and often do valuable work in saving
property on the wharfs and piers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VERNON'S BROTHER</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span> any one had asked Vernon Houston
what he wanted more than anything
in the whole world, he would not have
waited an instant before replying, "A
brother!"</p>

<p>He had pets of all kinds,&mdash;rabbits,
guinea pigs, a dog, and a pony; but still
his lonely little heart longed for a brother,
some one to enjoy all his pleasures, some
one to go to school with, some one to play
with when his father and mother were
away and only Jane was left in the kitchen.</p>

<p>To be sure he had books and games
without number, but he soon grew tired of
reading, and what good were games when
there was no one to play with him?</p>

<p>Of course he had plenty of school friends
and playmates, but on stormy days, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
when he and Jane were left all alone, there
were never any boys to be found,&mdash;just
when he most needed them.</p>

<p>In spite of his dog and his pony and all
his rabbits he couldn't help being a little
lonely. Whenever he saw two brothers
playing together, he always thought how
glad he would be to exchange every one
of his pets&mdash;pony and all&mdash;for a little
brother, and every Christmas he wrote a
letter to Santa Claus to ask for one.</p>

<p>On his ninth birthday his father and
mother surprised him by saying that they
were going to Boston. They promised to
come home the next day and bring him
the best birthday gift he ever had in all
his life; but what this delightful gift was
to be they would not tell. It was a secret,
and a very good secret, too.</p>

<p>To tell the truth Mr. and Mrs. Houston
had decided to adopt a little boy. They
had been planning it for some time, but
Vernon knew nothing about it. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
always been sorry for their brotherless son,
and they knew how many boys there are
in the world who have no home, no father
and mother, no one to love them and care
for them.</p>

<p>They had been waiting to hear of some
homeless lad, who was good and honest,
to take into their home and hearts, and to
become the "little brother" for whom
Vernon longed. At last a man telephoned
from Boston that he had found just the
boy they wanted, so they set off at once
to bring home the birthday gift.</p>

<p>When they looked into Harry's bright
eyes and honest face, they were not long
in deciding that he was just the right boy
for them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Houston bent and kissed him, and
Mr. Houston took him by the hand, saying
kindly, "Harry, how would you like
to come and live with us, to be our boy,
and a brother to our son, Vernon?"</p>

<p>Harry was too happy to say a word, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
his big brown eyes answered for him, and
it was not long before they were all three
on their way to Greenfield.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen Vernon when
his father and mother arrived with the
birthday gift.</p>

<p>"Here, my boy, is the secret,&mdash;the
brother you have been waiting for so long,"
said Mr. Houston. "Let me introduce
you to your new brother Harry. He has
come to stay as long as he can be happy
with you. He is only a few months younger
than you are, and I don't see why you two
boys can't have a good time together."</p>

<p>It seemed as if the boys had only to
look straight into each other's eyes to
become the best of friends, and if you
could have watched them as the days
went by, you would have thought they were
as happy as children could possibly be.</p>

<p>Vernon brought out all his playthings
and gave half of them to Harry; he
showed him how to make Rags do all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sorts of funny tricks; he let him feed the
rabbits and the guinea-pigs; and when
they went to ride, he let Harry drive the
pony. How the little fellow did enjoy
holding the reins and riding in a red pony-cart
like those he had looked at so many
times before with longing eyes.</p>

<p>The two boys ran races, played ball,
and went to school together. Vernon
never complained of being lonely, and as
for Harry, he was the happiest boy you
ever saw. He tried to show how grateful
he was for everything that Mr. and Mrs.
Houston did for him; and he resolved to
study hard, to be honest and true, and
never to forget to do all in his power to
repay his kind friends.</p>

<p>The brothers had a room together with
two white beds standing side by side. One
night Mr. Houston came home very late
and found that the boys had gone to bed,
so he went to their room to bid them good-night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>He was much surprised to find both the
boys reading a book, with a lighted lamp
on a little stand between their beds.</p>

<p>"My sons," he said very seriously, "I
always like to see you enjoying your books,
but I cannot allow you to read after you
are in bed."</p>

<p>"Why not, Father?" questioned Vernon.</p>

<p>"Because it is a dangerous thing to do,"
Mr. Houston replied. "You might fall
asleep without blowing out the light.
It is a common thing to have such an
accident. Lamps are often tipped over
and houses set on fire in just that way."</p>

<p>"But, Father," urged Vernon, "please
let us finish this chapter. It will take only
a few minutes longer, and it is such a good
story."</p>

<p>"You may finish this one chapter," Mr.
Houston answered. "Then you must
blow out the light, and after to-night
there must be no more reading in bed
with a lighted lamp."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>The boys meant to obey their father;
but they were both very sleepy, and before
the end of the chapter was reached,
they were sound asleep.</p>

<p>It was not long before Vernon restlessly
threw out his arm. His hand hit the lamp
and knocked it off the table, and the oil
spread over the carpet, taking fire from
the burning wick.</p>

<p>Rags had crept into the room to sleep
on his little master's bed, and the noise
waked him. When he saw the blazing oil,
he jumped down and ran out into the hall,
barking with all his might.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Houston rushed upstairs
and beat out the flames with heavy rugs,
before the bed clothing caught fire; but
the boys were terribly frightened, and
no one ever had to tell them again
not to read in bed with a lighted lamp.
They had learned a good lesson, and little
Rags had become a never-to-be-forgotten
hero.</p>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span><i>Why was Vernon lonely?</i></p>

<p><i>What gift did he have on his ninth birthday?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did the boys set a lighted lamp on
the table beside their bed?</i></p>

<p><i>How was it overturned?</i></p>

<p><i>Where was Rags? What did he do?</i></p>

<p><i>How should this fire have been avoided?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A lamp, a lantern, or an oil-stove should
not be placed where it could possibly be
upset. Neither should it be blown out
until the wick has been turned half-way
down, as the flame might be blown into
the oil, thus causing an explosion. To
turn down the wick too low, however, is
also dangerous.</p>

<p>All brass or metal work on a lamp or
oil-stove should be kept clean and bright,
as dirty metal retains the heat, thus causing
vapor to rise from the oil, and making
an explosion possible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WORLD'S GREAT FIRES</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since men have built their
houses of wood, and have crowded
their dwellings together in cities,
there have been terrible conflagrations,
destroying, in two or three days, property
which has been gathered together at a
great cost of time and labor. Thousands
of people have been made homeless, and
fortunes have been lost in a single night.</p>

<p>As long ago as 65 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, when Nero
was Emperor of Rome, more than half the
city was destroyed by a great fire, and the
people were obliged to flee to the hills for
safety.</p>

<p>Constantinople has suffered eleven conflagrations,
by which more than 130,000
homes have been destroyed; and in Japan,
where the houses are built of bamboo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
paper, fires sweep through the streets
with the rapidity of the wind, burning
hundreds of the little low buildings in a
single hour. In fact, these fires are of
such common occurrence, and are so destructive,
that the Japanese people keep
their valuable possessions in fireproof storehouses
in their own gardens, and they often
have the frame and paper walls of a new
house in this "godown," ready to put
together as soon as the ashes of their
former dwelling are cool enough not to set
another fire.</p>

<p>In September, 1666, the city of London
was devastated by flames. The fire broke
out in a baker's shop, and spread on all
sides so rapidly that it could not be extinguished
before two-thirds of the city
had been destroyed. All the sky was
illuminated by the flames, and the light
could be seen for forty miles. More than
a thousand houses were in flames at the
same time. Night was as light as day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and the air was so hot that the people could
do nothing but stand still and look on
at their own ruin.</p>

<p>In those days there was little fire-fighting
apparatus, nothing at all to be
compared with our modern conveniences;
and the flames, fanned by a strong east
wind, swept through the narrow streets,
fairly eating up the houses, which were
built entirely of wood. The ruins covered
436 acres; 400 streets were laid waste,
13,200 houses were destroyed, and 200,000
persons were made homeless.</p>

<p>The first of the great conflagrations in
our own country was the fire in Chicago
in October, 1871. This fire was caused by
a cow kicking over a lighted lantern in a
barn; and, from this simple start, three
and one-half square miles were laid waste,
200 persons were killed, 17,450 buildings
were destroyed, and 98,500 persons were
made homeless. The flames were fanned
by a fierce gale, and spread with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
rapidity, raging uncontrolled for two days
and nights.</p>

<p>In November, 1872, the city of
Boston was visited by fire. The conflagration
was confined almost wholly
to the business district, and while
only 800 buildings were destroyed, the
loss amounted to $73,000,000, and hundreds
of men lost their entire fortune.</p>

<p>In April, 1906, San Francisco was devastated
by the most terrible fire known
to all history. The fire was preceded by
earthquake shocks, and, with the falling
walls and chimneys, fires were started in
different sections of the city. The earthquake
also caused the bursting of the water
mains in the streets, so that it was impossible
to hold the flames in check; and before
they were at last extinguished the
burned area was over three times greater
than that of the Chicago fire, and ten
times that of the Boston fire. This fire
destroyed $350,000,000 worth of property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and over 300,000 persons were made
homeless.</p>

<p>The Baltimore fire, in 1904, burned over
140 acres, and $85,000,000 worth of property
was lost.</p>

<p>This great waste is a serious problem
which confronts our country; but each
one of us, by being careful, may do his
share toward lessening the loss by fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NEW YEAR'S EVE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the last night of the year, and a
happy little group was sitting around
the supper table in the Hawleys'
pleasant dining-room.</p>

<p>There were Mr. and Mrs. Hawley and
their two children,&mdash;Leland, who was a
wide-awake boy of fourteen, and Rachel,
who was two years younger. Their cousins,
Lawrence and Dorothy, had come
to spend several weeks with them. As
they were all about the same age, the
four children were having a merry time
together.</p>

<p>The Hawley homestead was in a little
country town in New England; but
Lawrence and Dorothy had always lived
in the city of New Orleans and they knew
nothing about winter and winter sports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
You can imagine how much they enjoyed
everything, especially the snow.</p>

<p>They were all laughing and chatting
merrily when suddenly Mr. Hawley rose
and went to the window. "I hear sleigh-bells,"
he said. "A sleigh is driving into
our yard."</p>

<p>In a moment more a knock was heard
at the door, and a note was handed to Mrs.
Hawley telling her that her sister was
very ill.</p>

<p>This sister lived several miles away,
but Mrs. Hawley felt that she must go
to her at once, so her husband decided to
harness his pair of bays and drive her over.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to leave you, children,"
Mrs. Hawley said, as she tied on her bonnet.
"Have just as good a time as you can,
and I will trust you not to do anything
that would displease me."</p>

<p>"I will take Mother over and return as
soon as possible," said Mr. Hawley, as he
tucked his wife into the sleigh. "I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
try to be home before ten o'clock; but
don't sit up for me. Be good children and
take care of everything."</p>

<p>"Perhaps my sister will be better and I
can come home to-morrow," added Mrs.
Hawley cheerfully. Then she kissed the
children and bade them good-bye, and
the horses dashed off down the road with a
great jingling of bells.</p>

<p>The girls looked a little sober when they
went back into the big empty farmhouse,
but Leland tried to cheer them up. "We'll
have a jolly time keeping house," he said.
"What's the first thing to be done?"</p>

<p>"The dishes, of course," replied his
sister; "there are always dishes to do,
no matter what happens."</p>

<p>The boys cleared the table, while Rachel
and Dorothy washed and wiped the dishes,
and set the table for breakfast. Then they
brought in some wood and built a big fire
in the fireplace.</p>

<p>The flames went roaring up the chimney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and the children sat for a long time before
the fire, watching the rings of sparks that
twisted in and out on the soot-covered
bricks. "Children going home from
school," they called them, and the last
one to burn out was the one to stay after
school for a whipping.</p>

<p>"Let's roast some chestnuts," Leland
suggested, when there was a good bed of
hot ashes, and he ran up in the attic to get
a bagful that he had been saving for just
such an occasion.</p>

<p>It was fun to push the chestnuts into
the fire with a long poker and then watch
them pop out when they were roasted.
Sometimes they flew across the room, or
under the tables and chairs, and then there
was a great hunt for them.</p>

<p>"We might wish on the chestnuts,"
Rachel suggested. "If they pop out on
the hearth, our wish will come true, but
if they fly into the fire, it won't."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Lawrence; "that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
just the thing to do. Girls first,&mdash;you
begin, Rachel."</p>

<p>"No, Dorothy is my guest," replied his
cousin; "she must have the first turn."</p>

<p>Dorothy poked her chestnut into the
ashes. "I wish I might spend the whole
year up here with you," she said; and
when the nut popped right into her lap
the other children joined hands and danced
around her in a circle.</p>

<p>Then it was Rachel's turn, and she
wished for higher marks in school than she
ever had before; but the chestnut jumped
into the fire and blazed up merrily.</p>

<p>"That's because your marks are good
enough anyway," her brother told her.
"What is your wish, Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"I wish that I might go to London in an
airship," Lawrence replied.</p>

<p>"And I wish that I might go to the biggest
circus in the world," added Leland,
poking his chestnut in beside his cousin's.</p>

<p>One of the nuts popped into the farthest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
corner of the hearth, and the other burned
to a little black cinder; but the boys
couldn't decide whose chestnut it was
that flew away, so they couldn't tell
which one was to have his wish.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you something that is just
as good as flying," said Leland. "Let's
get out our bob-sled and go coasting.
There's a moon to-night, and it is almost
as light as day."</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to leave the
house," objected Rachel. "Father and
Mother are both away, you know, and
they told us to be careful."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be a goose!" her brother replied.
"The house can take care of itself."</p>

<p>"We ought to put out all the lamps
then, and cover the fire with ashes," said
thoughtful Rachel.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Leland. "We
won't be gone long. The fire is all right.
There is nothing left but the back-log, and
that will not burn much longer."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>"I'm going to put out the lamps any
way," said his sister. "I feel sure that
Mother never leaves them lighted when
there is no one in the house."</p>

<p>"Well, hurry up then," urged Leland.
"You girls bundle up well, and Lawrence
and I will get out the sled."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boys came running
up to the door with the sled, and as soon
as the girls were well tucked in, they
took hold of the rope and pranced off
like wild horses.</p>

<p>There was a full moon, and they could
see the road perfectly. The air was crisp
and clear, and the snow shone and sparkled
like diamonds.</p>

<p>"It seems like a winter fairyland," said
Dorothy. "Let's keep watch for the
fairies. They ought to come trooping
across the fields dressed in pretty white
furs, and dance under the trees to the
music of sleigh-bells."</p>

<p>The sled seemed to fairly fly over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
snow, and when they came to the top of
the long hill, the boys jumped on and they
all went coasting down, with shouts of
laughter.</p>

<p>Up and down, up and down they went;
and such fun as they did have! Of course
they stayed out much longer than they
meant to; but at last Rachel said, "It
must be getting late. Father was coming
home at ten, and he will wonder what has
become of us."</p>

<p>The boys trotted home again more
slowly, and as they came in sight of the
house they saw that Mr. Hawley had
already arrived before them. The rooms
downstairs were brightly lighted, and when
they passed the living-room windows they
saw him hurrying to and fro as if he were
busy about some work.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Father," called Leland.
"We've been out coasting."</p>

<p>"And we've had such a good time!"
added Dorothy. Then, as she entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
living-room, she exclaimed in amazement:
"What is the matter, Uncle Henry? What
have you been doing in here?"</p>

<p>Her uncle crossed the room and opened
the windows. Then he took off his hat
and overcoat, and wiped great beads of
perspiration from his face, while the
children stood in the doorway looking
around at the disordered room.</p>

<p>"When I came home the house was on
fire," he answered, "and I've had a pretty
busy time for the last ten minutes. You
children must have left a log burning on
the hearth, and a spark flew out and set
the rug on fire. Then the table and one
of the chairs caught fire from the rug,
and if I hadn't come home just when I
did, we might not have had any home by
this time."</p>

<p>"It was my fault, Father," spoke up
Leland. "Rachel wanted to bury the
log in the ashes; but I told her it wouldn't
do any harm to leave it burning."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>"I suppose it was partly my fault, too,"
said Mr. Hawley. "I've always intended
to buy a wire screen for this fireplace. It
is never safe to go out of the room and
leave an open fire. When we go to town
to-morrow to buy a new rug, we will buy
a screen and a fender, too."</p>

<p>"And the next time we light a fire on
the hearth," added Lawrence, "we'll stay
at home and take care of it, even if it is
a moonlight night and we do want to go
coasting."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Why did Lawrence and Dorothy enjoy
the New England winter?</i></p>

<p><i>What did the children do after Mr. and
Mrs. Hawley went away?</i></p>

<p><i>Why did Rachel put out the lights before
leaving the house?</i></p>

<p><i>What accident happened as a result of
leaving a burning log in the fireplace?</i></p>

<p><i>How could this accident have been prevented?</i></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>It is never safe to have an open fire in
a fireplace unless it is protected with a
wire screen. Sparks often fly from the
burning wood and set fire to rugs, draperies,
and clothing, or sometimes a blazing
log rolls out on to the floor.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to leave the fire before
it is entirely burned out, the logs may be
taken from the andirons and buried in the
ashes. This should always be done before
the fire is left for the night, as a change of
wind might cause a smouldering log to
become a dangerous firebrand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHRISTMAS CANDLES</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was Christmas Eve,&mdash;the happiest,
merriest time in all the year,&mdash;and
no one need look at a calendar to know
it. The shop windows were full of gifts
and toys of every description, and in some
of the larger shops jolly old Santa Claus
himself was waiting to shake hands with
the boys, or pat the curly heads of the
little girls.</p>

<p>Crowds of people were hurrying to and
fro on the streets, their arms filled with
packages of all shapes and sizes. Here
was a man carrying a doll carriage, and a
woman with a tiny wheelbarrow. There
was a girl with a pair of snowshoes, and a
boy with a Christmas-tree over his shoulder;
but no matter how heavy were the
bundles, or how crowded the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
everyone seemed happy, and "Merry
Christmas!" "Merry Christmas to you!"
was heard on every side in friendly
greeting.</p>

<p>Just enough snow had fallen to bring
out the sleighs, and the jingling sleigh-bells
added their merry music to the
Christmas gayety. The air was clear and
crisp, and beyond the city streets, with
their glare of electricity, the stars shone
with a clear light, just as the Star of the
East shone so many centuries ago upon
the little Babe of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Yes, Christmas was everywhere. It
shone from the stars, and from the happy
faces of the children; and it made the
whole world glad with the gladness of
giving.</p>

<p>In the little town of Lindale, just as in
all the other towns and cities, there was
the greatest excitement. The houses were
brightly lighted, people were hurrying to
and fro in the streets, doors were carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
opened and closed, stockings were hung
beside the chimneys, and Christmas trees
were decorated with tinsel and candles
and loaded with gifts for young and
old.</p>

<p>But in the big brick church in the center
of the town was the best Christmas tree of
all. It stood on the floor and held its head
up to the very ceiling, where a star gleamed
with a golden light like the brightest star
in the sky.</p>

<p>The branches were covered with frost
that sparkled like diamonds, and under
the trees were heaped big snowbanks of
white cotton. Ropes of tinsel and strings
of popcorn were twined in and out in long
festoons, and tiny Christmas candles were
set everywhere among the branches. Big
dolls and little dolls peeped out through
the green leaves, and here and there were
Teddy bears, white rabbits, curly-haired
puppies, woolly lambs, parrots on their
perches, and canaries in tiny cages,&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
toys, of course, but toys so wonderfully
made that they looked as if they were
really and truly alive.</p>

<p class="caption">Fire Drill for the Firemen</p>

<p>Piled high on the banks of snow were
the Christmas gifts, big packages and
little ones, all in white paper tied with
red and green ribbons; and when the
candles were lighted the whole tree looked
as if it had been brought from fairyland
and set down here to make the children
happy.</p>

<p>This tree, with all its gifts and decorations,
had been arranged by the pupils and
teachers of the Sunday-school for the little
children of the Lindale Mission.</p>

<p>For two or three months these "Willing
Helpers," as they called themselves, had
devoted all their spare minutes to getting
everything ready. They had contributed
toys and games, they had earned the money
for some of the gifts, they had brought
tinsel and gilded nuts from home, they had
strung the popcorn, and, best of all, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
had spent two happy evenings decorating
the tree and tying up the packages.</p>

<p>Now, at last, it was Christmas Eve.
At seven o'clock the church bells began to
peal out their merriest welcome, and from
all the houses came boys and girls with
their fathers and mothers, eager to enjoy
the pleasure of making others happy.</p>

<p>The little children of the Mission school
were gathered in the chapel, and when
everything was ready the doors were
thrown wide open and they came marching
in to see the tree.</p>

<p>As they moved slowly up the long aisle
toward their seats in the front of the church,
they sang a Christmas carol, keeping time
with their marching; and their childish
voices made the very rafters ring with
joy.</p>

<p>The church bells pealed out once more,
and a little boy at the head of the procession
jingled some sleigh-bells, while every
one joined in the chorus of the song:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">"Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas bells,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! sweetly, sweetly, chime;</div>
<div class="verse">Let your happy voices on the breezes swell,</div>
<div class="verse">This merry, merry Christmas time."</div>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The Sunday-school pupils answered with
another carol, and the superintendent
made a little speech of welcome. Then,
when the children were all on tiptoe with
excitement, there was a loud jangling of
bells in the street, a stamping of feet at
the door, and in came Santa Claus himself,
with his great fur coat, his long white
beard, and a heavy pack on his back.</p>

<p>Behind him came six pages, dressed in
red and white, with little packs on their
backs. They ran up and down the aisles,
giving bags of candy to the children, and
all the while the Christmas candles burned
lower and lower, the tiny flames danced and
flickered, the hat wax melted and dripped
from bough to bough.</p>

<p>At last the superintendent of the Sunday-school
began giving out the presents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
some of the teachers went to help him.
Santa Claus himself called out the names,
and the children ran up to receive their
gifts from his hands.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this joy and happiness
everyone forgot the lighted candles,
until suddenly some one screamed, "Fire,
fire! The tree is on fire!"</p>

<p>Then what a commotion there was!
Men ran forward to put out the blaze, but
it was so high up that no one could reach
it. Two or three boys hurried down to
the cellar for the step-ladder, several men
ran to get pails of water, women snatched
up their little children and took them into
the street, hatless and coatless, while the
teachers gathered up the few remaining
gifts and tried to calm their frightened
pupils.</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell it, the
boys came rushing upstairs with a step-ladder,
men came back with buckets of
water, and Santa Claus climbed up to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
out the fire which was running swiftly
from one branch to another. In his hurry
he knocked off another candle, it dropped
into the white cotton and set the snowbanks
blazing; but there were plenty of
men to put out the flames before they
could do any damage.</p>

<p>When the fire was all out, and the
children had gone home, and were tucked
safely in their little beds, the tree was left
standing alone in the dark church. But
it no longer looked as if it had come from
fairyland. All the upper branches were
burned off, wet strings of tinsel and popcorn
drooped from the ends of the boughs,
the gold star was black with smoke, and
the snowbanks seemed to have suffered
from a January thaw.</p>

<p>The next morning some of the fathers
and mothers came to clear away the remains
of the festivity and its disaster,
and the children came to help them.
"We'll never have another Christmas-tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as long as we live," declared one of
the older girls. "Oh, yes, we will," her
brother told her. "We'll have one next
year for the Mission children; but we shall
know better than to have it lighted with
candles."</p>

<p>"Or, if we do use candles," added one of
the teachers, "we'll have six boys to
watch them every minute, and we will put
out every one before we distribute a single
gift."</p>

<p>"That's right," said a voice that sounded
very much like that of Santa Claus;
"this fire has taught us a good lesson, but
it came very near spoiling all our happiness.
No one can be too careful of fire
where there are so many little children.
One child's life is worth more than all the
Christmas candles in the world."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>What is the happiest day of the year for
children?</i></p>

<p><i>When is Christmas Day?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><i>What do you do on Christmas Eve?</i></p>

<p><i>Have you ever had a Christmas tree?</i></p>

<p><i>How was it decorated?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is it dangerous to light it with
candles?</i></p>

<p><i>Why is it dangerous to use cotton to represent
frost and snow?</i></p>

<p><i>How was this fire caused?</i></p>

<p><i>How could it have been avoided?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Christmas candles cause many fires. A
Christmas tree should be fastened firmly
so that it cannot be upset. It should not
be decorated with paper, cotton, or any
other inflammable material. Cotton should
not be used to represent frost or snow,
as it catches fire easily. If the snow effect
is desired, asbestos or mineral wool can
be used with safety.</p>

<p>The candles should be set upright in
the holders, and should be placed so that
they cannot set fire to the branches above.
They should never be lighted by children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
They should be watched constantly, and
should be extinguished before the gifts
are distributed, as they sometimes set fire
to clothing. This more frequently happens
if the person who distributes the
gifts is dressed as Santa Claus, as his long
beard and the cotton fun on his red coat
and cap are especially inflammable.</p>

<p>Electricity is a safer method of lighting
a Christmas tree. Wiring is now especially
prepared which can be easily applied to
the tree, and connected to the chandelier
like an ordinary electric lamp. Bulbs in
the shapes of birds, animals, clowns, etc.,
make the tree very attractive.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF FIRE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> case of fire it is necessary above all
things to "<i>keep cool</i>." Try not to
get excited, and so waste precious
moments in running about to no purpose.
Act quickly, but keep your mind on what
you are doing.</p>

<p>If it is only a little blaze, throw water
on the thing that is burning, try to smother
the flames with a heavy rug, or beat them
out with a wet broom. If oil is burning,
never pour on water, as this only spreads
the oil and makes matters worse. For an
oil fire use sand, earth from flower-pots, or
big panfuls of flour.</p>

<p>If the fire is well started and you see at
once that you cannot put it out alone,
call for help by shouting "Fire!" at the
door or window where some one will be
likely to hear you.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Then summon the fire department. The
best way to do this is to run to the nearest
fire-alarm box, break the glass which will
release the key, then unlock the door and
pull down the hook. This rings the alarm
at the engine-house. Everyone should
know the location of the nearest box,
and the way to ring the alarm.</p>

<p>If you can send some one else to ring
the alarm, telephone to the nearest fire
station. The number of this station should
always hang in a conspicuous place near
your telephone. If there is no fire alarm
system, and you have no telephone, shout
"Fire!" and arouse the neighbors.</p>

<p>If you leave the house to summon help,
be sure to <i>close the door</i>. Fresh air will
make the flames burn faster, and spread
more rapidly. If the fire is in one room,
try to keep it there by closing the doors
and windows. If it is in a closet, shut the
door until you can get help. In this way
you may save the whole house from
burning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>After you have given the alarm try to
save what you can. Valuable papers
should be taken care of first; then jewelry,
silverware, heirlooms, and anything you
especially treasure. Think about what
you are doing. <i>Don't waste time</i> trying
to save a looking-glass or clock, when
you might put a handful of expensive
silverware in your pocket.</p>

<p>If you are awakened in the night by the
smell of smoke or the crackling of fire,
do not stop to dress. Wrap yourself in a
blanket or quilt, and waken everyone in
the house, remembering especially little
children and sick or aged people.</p>

<p>Then, after you have called the fire
department, find out where the fire is and
what it is best to do. If the fire is on the
lower floor, do not go upstairs, as you
might be unable to come down again.
If the halls are filled with smoke, you can
pass through them more easily by crawling
on your hands and knees, for the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and hot air rise toward the ceiling, and
the air is cooler and purer near the floor.</p>

<p>If it is necessary for you to go into a
room that is filled with dense smoke, tie
a wet towel or sponge over your nose and
mouth. If you have no time to do this,
hold a heavy woollen cloth over the lower
part of your face, or, at least, turn up your
coat collar.</p>

<p>If the lower part of the house is on fire,
and you cannot go down the stairs, prepare
to escape through the window, but
<i>do not jump out</i> recklessly. First of all,
close the door to keep out the fire and
smoke as long as possible. Then drop
the mattresses and pillows to the ground
so that they will form a break in case you
should fall. If possible tie the sheets and
blankets firmly together to make a rope.
Fasten it securely to the bed-post, after
you have drawn the bed close to the
window, and then, when it is absolutely
necessary, let yourself down, hand over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
hand. This is a dangerous method of
escape, and should only be used as a last
resort. Try to wait for the firemen to
rescue you.</p>

<p>If you see a fire anywhere, no matter
how small, it is always best to give it
immediate attention. If it is only a burning
match or cigarette stump, step on it.
If it is a fire in leaves, grass, or brush, put
it out yourself or call for help. If it is in a
house, notify the occupants at once, as
they may not know anything about it.
If the house is unoccupied, or the family
is away from home, call the fire department.
If a barn or stable is on fire, the
first thing to do is to save the live stock.</p>

<p>After the fire is all out, the next care
should be to protect the house and its
contents from further damage by fire or
theft, and to carry articles which have
been taken out to a place of safety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIRST AID</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span> a person's clothing is on fire, he should
neither run nor scream, as running
fans the flames, and screaming causes
deep breathing, thereby drawing the intense
heat into the lungs.</p>

<p>To extinguish the flames wrap the person
tightly in a rug, blanket, or heavy woollen
coat, and roll him upon the floor. This
method is much more effective than using
water. Often a person whose clothing is
on fire will resist any efforts to aid him,
owing to his intense fright.</p>

<p>When the flesh is burned or scalded, the
first object of treatment is to relieve the
pain.</p>

<p class="caption">Fire raging through the deserted streets in San Francisco</p>

<p>This is best accomplished by excluding
all air from contact with the injured surface,
either by dredging the part thickly
with flour, if the skin is not broken, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
by applying bandages. The best bandages
are made of lint, cotton, or soft cloths
moistened with water, or, better still,
with water to which a little baking-soda
has been added.</p>



<p>Be especially careful to remove all
clothing covering a burn with the utmost
care. Never try to pull it off. Cut it
away, a tiny piece at a time, if necessary,
so that the skin may not be broken and
thus cause a more serious wound. Never
hold a burn in front of the fire, as this
only makes matters worse. As soon as the
clothing has been removed apply the
bandages, and if the burn is at all serious
send for a physician.</p>

<p>If the person receives serious burns, he
may become faint or lose consciousness
from the effect of the shock to the nervous
system. If this occurs, lay him flat on the
floor or couch; preserve all body heat by covering
him with warm clothing; apply cool
applications to his head and heat to his feet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span> a person is overcome by inhaling
smoke, it may be necessary to resort
to artificial respiration. This is done
as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_244.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>

<p>Lay the person to be treated flat on his
back. Then kneel behind his head, grasp
both arms near the elbow, and move them
horizontally, carrying them away from the
body and describing a semicircle until the
hands meet above the head, as in Fig. 1.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
When this position has been reached, give
the arms a steady pull for two seconds.
By doing this the lungs are filled with air,
because the ribs are drawn upward, thereby
increasing the capacity of the chest.</p>

<p>The next step is to return the arms to
the first position alongside the chest, as
in Fig. 2, making considerable pressure
against the lower ribs, and thereby forcing
the impure air out of the lungs.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
